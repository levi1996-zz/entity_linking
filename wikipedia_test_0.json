        "wikipedia_content": "A sonnet is a poem in a specific form which originated in Italy; Giacomo da Lentini is credited with its invention.\nThe term sonnet is derived from the Italian word sonetto (from Old Proven\u00e7al sonet a little poem, from son song, from Latin sonus a sound). By the thirteenth century it signified a poem of fourteen lines that follows a strict rhyme scheme and specific structure. Conventions associated with the sonnet have evolved over its history. Writers of sonnets are sometimes called \"sonneteers\", although the term can be used derisively.\n\n\n== Petrarchan sonnet ==\n\nThe sonnet was created by Giacomo da Lentini, head of the Sicilian School under Emperor Frederick II. Guittone d'Arezzo rediscovered it and brought it to Tuscany where he adapted it to his language when he founded the Siculo-Tuscan School, or Guittonian school of poetry (1235\u20131294). He wrote almost 250 sonnets. Other Italian poets of the time, including Dante Alighieri (1265\u20131321) and Guido Cavalcanti (c. 1250\u20131300), wrote sonnets, but the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch.  Other fine examples were written by Michelangelo.\nThe structure of a typical Italian sonnet of the time included two parts that together formed a compact form of \"argument\". First, the octave, forms the \"proposition\", which describes a \"problem\", or \"question\", followed by a sestet (two tercets), which proposes a \"resolution\". Typically, the ninth line initiates what is called the \"turn\", or \"volta\", which signals the move from proposition to resolution. Even in sonnets that don't strictly follow the problem/resolution structure, the ninth line still often marks a \"turn\" by signaling a change in the tone, mood, or stance of the poem.\nLater, the ABBA ABBA pattern became the standard for Italian sonnets. For the sestet there were two different possibilities: CDE CDE and CDC CDC. In time, other variants on this rhyming scheme were introduced, such as CDCDCD.  Petrarch typically used an ABBA ABBA pattern for the octave, followed by either CDE CDE or CDC CDC rhymes in the sestet. The Crybin variant of the Italian sonnet has the rhyme scheme ABBA CDDC EFG EFG.\nIn English, both the English or Shakespearean sonnet, and the Italian Petrarchan sonnet are traditionally written in iambic pentameter.\nThe first known sonnets in English, written by Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, used the Italian, Petrarchan form, as did sonnets by later English poets, including John Milton, Thomas Gray, William Wordsworth and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Early twentieth-century American poet Edna St. Vincent Millay also wrote mostly Petrarchan sonnets.On His Blindness by Milton, gives a sense of the Petrarchan rhyme scheme:\n\n\n=== Dante's variation ===\nMost Sonnets in Dante's La Vita Nuova are Petrarchan. Chapter VII gives sonnet \"O voi che per la via\", with two sestets (AABAAB AABAAB) and two quatrains (CDDC CDDC), and Ch. VIII, \"Morte villana\", with two sestets (AABBBA AABBBA) and two quatrains (CDDC CDDC).\n\n\n== Occitan ==\nThe sole confirmed surviving sonnet in the Occitan language is confidently dated to 1284, and is conserved only in troubadour manuscript P, an Italian chansonnier of 1310, now XLI.42 in the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence. It was written by Paolo Lanfranchi da Pistoia and is addressed to Peter III of Aragon. It employs the rhyme scheme ABAB ABAB CDCDCD.  This poem is historically interesting for its information on north Italian perspectives concerning the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the conflict between the Angevins and Aragonese for Sicily. Peter III and the Aragonese cause was popular in northern Italy at the time and Paolo's sonnet is a celebration of his victory over the Angevins and Capetians in the Aragonese Crusade:\n\nAn Occitan sonnet, dated to 1321 and assigned to one \"William of Almarichi\", is found in Jean de Nostredame and cited in Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni's, Istoria della volgar poesia. It congratulates Robert of Naples on his recent victory. Its authenticity is dubious. There are also two poorly regarded sonnets by the Italian Dante de Maiano.\n\n\n== In France ==\n\nIn the 16th century, around Ronsard (1524\u20131585)), Joachim du Bellay (1522\u20131560) and Jean Antoine de Ba\u00eff (1532\u20131589), there formed a group of radical young noble poets of the court (generally known today as La Pl\u00e9iade, although use of this term is debated), who began writing in, amongst other forms of poetry, the Petrarchan sonnet cycle (developed around an amorous encounter or an idealized woman). The character of La Pl\u00e9iade literary program was given in Du Bellay's manifesto, the \"Defense and Illustration of the French Language\" (1549), which maintained that French (like the Tuscan of Petrarch and Dante) was a worthy language for literary expression and which promulgated a program of linguistic and literary production (including the imitation of Latin and Greek genres) and purification.\nBy the late 17th century poets on increasingly relied on stanza forms incorporating rhymed couplets, and by the 18th century fixed-form poems \u2013 and, in particular, the sonnet \u2013 were largely avoided. The resulting versification \u2013 less constrained by meter and rhyme patterns than Renaissance poetry \u2013 more closely mirrored prose.The Romantics were responsible for a return to (and sometimes a modification of) many of the fixed-form poems used during the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as for the creation of new forms. The sonnet however was little used until the Parnassians brought it back into favor, and the sonnet would subsequently find its most significant practitioner in Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) . The traditional French sonnet form was however significantly modified by Baudelaire, who used 32 different forms of sonnet with non-traditional rhyme patterns to great effect in his Les Fleurs du mal.\n\n\n== In English ==\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\n\nWhen English sonnets were introduced by Thomas Wyatt (1503\u20131542) in the early 16th century, his sonnets and those of his contemporary the Earl of Surrey were chiefly translations from the Italian of Petrarch and the French of Ronsard and others. While Wyatt introduced the sonnet into English, it was Surrey who developed the rhyme scheme \u2013 ABAB CDCD EFEF GG \u2013 which now characterizes the English sonnet. Having previously circulated in manuscripts only, both poets' sonnets were first published in Richard Tottel's Songes and Sonnetts, better known as Tottel's Miscellany (1557).\nIt was, however, Sir Philip Sidney's sequence Astrophel and Stella (1591) that started the English vogue for sonnet sequences. The next two decades saw sonnet sequences by William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton, Samuel Daniel, Fulke Greville, William Drummond of Hawthornden, and many others. These sonnets were all essentially inspired by the Petrarchan tradition, and generally treat of the poet's love for some woman, with the exception of Shakespeare's sequence of 154 sonnets. The form is often named after Shakespeare, not because he was the first to write in this form but because he became its most famous practitioner. The form consists of fourteen lines structured as three quatrains and a couplet. The third quatrain generally introduces an unexpected sharp thematic or imagistic \"turn\", the volta. In Shakespeare's sonnets, however, the volta usually comes in the couplet, and usually summarizes the theme of the poem or introduces a fresh new look at the theme. With only a rare exception (for example, Shakespeare's Sonnet 145 in iambic tetrameter), the meter is iambic pentameter.\nThis example, Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 116\", illustrates the form (with some typical variances one may expect when reading an Elizabethan-age sonnet with modern eyes):\n\n* PRONUNCIATION/RHYME: Note changes in pronunciation since composition.** PRONUNCIATION/METER: \"Fixed\" pronounced as two-syllables, \"fix-ed\". *** RHYME/METER: Feminine-rhyme-ending, eleven-syllable alternative.\n\nThe Prologue to Romeo and Juliet is also a sonnet, as is Romeo and Juliet's first exchange in Act One, Scene Five, lines 104\u2013117, beginning with \"If I profane with my unworthiest hand\" (104) and ending with \"Then move not while my prayer's effect I take\" (117). The Epilogue to Henry V is also in the form of a sonnet.\n\n\n==== Spenserian ====\nA variant on the English form is the Spenserian sonnet, named after Edmund Spenser (c.1552\u20131599), in which the rhyme scheme is ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. The linked rhymes of his quatrains suggest the linked rhymes of such Italian forms as terza rima. This example is taken from Amoretti:\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn the 17th century, the sonnet was adapted to other purposes, with John Donne and George Herbert writing religious sonnets (see John Donne's Holy Sonnets), and John Milton using the sonnet as a general meditative poem. Probably Milton's most famous sonnet is \"When I Consider How My Light is Spent\", titled by a later editor \"On His Blindness\". Both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan rhyme schemes were popular throughout this period, as well as many variants.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe fashion for the sonnet went out with the Restoration, and hardly any sonnets were written between 1670 and Wordsworth's time. However, sonnets came back strongly with the French Revolution. Wordsworth himself wrote hundreds of sonnets, of which amongst the best-known are \"Upon Westminster Bridge\", \"The world is too much with us\" and \"London, 1802\" addressed to Milton; his sonnets were essentially modelled on Milton's. Keats and Shelley also wrote major sonnets; Keats's sonnets used formal and rhetorical patterns inspired partly by Shakespeare, and Shelley innovated radically, creating his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet \"Ozymandias\". Sonnets were written throughout the 19th century, but, apart from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese and the sonnets of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, there were few very successful traditional sonnets. Modern Love (1862) by George Meredith is a collection of fifty 16-line sonnets about the failure of his first marriage.\nGerard Manley Hopkins wrote several major sonnets, often in sprung rhythm, such as \"The Windhover\", and also several sonnet variants such as the 10\u200b1\u20442-line curtal sonnet \"Pied Beauty\" and the 24-line caudate sonnet \"That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire\". Hopkin's poetry was, however, not published until 1918. By the end of the 19th century, the sonnet had been adapted into a general-purpose form of great flexibility.\nIn the United States, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote many sonnets, among others the cycle Divina Commedia (Divine Comedy). He used the Petrarchan rhyme scheme. Emma Lazarus also published many sonnets. She is the author of perhaps the best-known American sonnet, \"The New Colossus\".In Canada during the last decades of the century, the Confederation Poets and especially Archibald Lampman were known for their sonnets, which were mainly on pastoral themes.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThis flexibility was extended even further in the 20th century. Among the major poets of the early Modernist period, Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay and E. E. Cummings all used the sonnet regularly. William Butler Yeats wrote the major sonnet \"Leda and the Swan\", which uses half rhymes. Wilfred Owen's sonnet \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" is another sonnet of the early 20th century. Spaniard Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca also wrote sonnets. W. H. Auden wrote two sonnet sequences and several other sonnets throughout his career, and widened the range of rhyme-schemes used considerably. Auden also wrote one of the first unrhymed sonnets in English, \"The Secret Agent\" (1928). Robert Lowell wrote five books of unrhymed \"American sonnets\", including his Pulitzer Prize-winning volume The Dolphin (1973). Half-rhymed, unrhymed, and even unmetrical sonnets have been very popular since 1950; perhaps the best works in the genre are Seamus Heaney's Glanmore Sonnets and Clearances, both of which use half rhymes, and Geoffrey Hill's mid-period sequence \"An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England\". The 1990s saw something of a formalist revival, however, and several traditional sonnets have been written in the past decade.\nOther modern poets, including Don Paterson, Edwin Morgan, Joan Brossa, Paul Muldoon have used the form. Wendy Cope's poem \"Stress\" is a sonnet. Elizabeth Bishop's inverted \"Sonnet\" was one of her last poems. Ted Berrigan's book, The Sonnets, \"is conventional almost exclusively in [the] line count)\". Paul Muldoon often experiments with 14 lines and sonnet rhymes, though without regular sonnet meter. The advent of the New Formalism movement in the United States has also contributed to contemporary interest in the sonnet. This includes the invention of the \"word sonnet\", which are fourteen line poems, with one word per line. Frequently allusive and imagistic, they can also be irreverent and playful. The Canadian poet Seymour Mayne published a few collections of word sonnets, and is one of the chief innovators of the form. Contemporary word sonnets combine a variation of styles often considered to be mutually exclusive to separate genres, as demonstrated in works such as \"An Ode to Mary\". The Greek poet Yannis Livadas in 1993 invented the so-called \"fusion sonnet\", which first appeared in a poetry collection entitled The Hanging Verses Of Babylon/\u039f\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03af \u03a3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 (Melani Books, Athens 2007), ISBN 978-960-8309-78-4.\n\n\n== In German ==\nPaulus Melissus (1539\u20131602) was the first to use the sonnet and the terza rima in German lyric. In his lifetime he was recognized as an author fully versed in Latin love poetry.The Sonnets to Orpheus are a cycle of 55 sonnets written in 1922 by the Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875\u20131926). It was first published the following year. Rilke, who is \"widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets\", wrote the cycle in a period of three weeks experiencing what he described a \"savage creative storm\". Inspired by the news of the death of Wera Ouckama Knoop (1900\u20131919), a playmate of Rilke's daughter Ruth, he dedicated them as a memorial, or Grab-Mal (literally \"grave-marker\"), to her memory.\n\n\n== In Dutch ==\nIn the Netherlands Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft wrote sonnets. A famous example is Mijn lief, mijn lief, mijn lief. Some of his poems were translated by Edmund Gosse. More recent examples include Martinus Nijhoff and Jan Kal.\n\n\n== In India ==\nIn the Indian subcontinent, sonnets have been written in the Assamese, Bengali, Dogri, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Sindhi and Urdu languages. Urdu poets, also influenced by English and other European poets, took to writing sonnets in the Urdu language rather late. Azmatullah Khan (1887\u20131923) is believed to have introduced this format to Urdu literature in the very early part of the 20th century. The other renowned Urdu poets who wrote sonnets were Akhtar Junagarhi, Akhtar Sheerani, Noon Meem Rashid, Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi, Salaam Machhalishahari and Wazir Agha. This example, a sonnet by Zia Fatehabadi taken from his collection Meri Tasveer, is in the usual English (Shakespearean) sonnet rhyme-scheme.\n\n\"Dubkani\"Pas e pardaa kisii ne mere armaanon kii mehfil ko (A)\nKuchh is andaaz se dekhaa, kuchh aise taur se dekhaa (B)\nGhubaar e aah se de kar jilaa aainaa e dil ko (A)\nHar ik soorat ko maine khoob dekhaa, ghaur se dekhaa (B)\nNazar aaii na woh soorat, mujhe jiskii tamanaa thii (C)\nBahut dhoondaa kiyaa gulshan mein, veeraane mein, bastii mein (D)\nMunnawar shamma e mehar o maah se din raat duniyaa thii (C)\nMagar chaaron taraf thaa ghup andheraa merii hastii mein (D)\nDil e majboor ko majrooh e ulfat kar diyaa kisne (E)\nMere ahsaas kii ghahraiion mein hai chubhan gham kii (F)\nMitaa kar jism, merii rooh ko apnaa liyaa kisne (E)\nJawanii ban gaii aamaajagaah sadmaat e paiham kii (F)\nHijaabaat e nazar kaa sisilaa tod aur aa bhii jaa (G)\nMujhe ik baar apnaa jalwaa e rangiin dikhaa bhii jaa. (G)\n\n\n== In Russian ==\nAlexander Pushkin's novel in verse Eugene Onegin consists almost entirely of 389 stanzas of iambic tetrameter with the unusual rhyme scheme \"AbAbCCddEffEgg\", where the uppercase letters represent feminine rhymes while the lowercase letters represent masculine rhymes. This form has come to be known as the \"Onegin stanza\" or the \"Pushkin sonnet.\"Unlike other traditional forms, such as the Petrarchan sonnet or Shakespearean sonnet, the Onegin stanza does not divide into smaller stanzas of four lines or two in an obvious way. There are many different ways this sonnet can be divided.\nIn post-Pushkin Russian poetry, the form has been utilized by authors as diverse as Mikhail Lermontov, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Jurgis Baltru\u0161aitis and Valery Pereleshin, in genres ranging from one-stanza lyrical piece to voluminous autobiography. Nevertheless, the Onegin stanza, being easily recognisable, is strongly identified as belonging to its creator.\nJohn Fuller's 1980 \"The Illusionists\" and Jon Stallworthy's 1987 \"The Nutcracker\" used this stanza form, and Vikram Seth's 1986 novel The Golden Gate is written wholly in Onegin stanzas.\n\n\n== In Polish ==\n\nThe sonnet was introduced into Polish literature in the 16th century by Jan Kochanowski, Miko\u0142aj S\u0119p-Szarzy\u0144ski and Sebastian Grabowiecki. Later in 1826 Adam Mickiewicz wrote a series known as Crimean Sonnets, which was translated into English by Edna Worthley Underwood. Sonnets were also  written by Adam Asnyk, Jan Kasprowicz and Leopold Staff. Polish poets usually shape their sonnets according to Italian or French practice. The English sonnet is not common. Kasprowicz used a Shelleyan rhyme scheme: ABA BCB CDC DED EE. Polish sonnets are typically written in either hendecasyllables (5+6 syllables) or Polish alexandrines (7+6 syllables).\n\n\n== In Czech ==\n\nThe sonnet was introduced into Czech literature at the beginning of the 19th century. The first great Czech sonneteer was J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r, who wrote a cycle of sonnets named Sl\u00e1vy Dcera (The daughter of Sl\u00e1va / The daughter of fame). Koll\u00e1r was Slovak and a supporter of Pan-Slavism, but wrote in Czech, as he disagreed that Slovak should be a separate language. Koll\u00e1r's magnum opus was planned as a Slavic epic poem as great as Dante's Divine Comedy. It consists of The Prelude written in quantitative hexameters, and sonnets. The number of poems increased in subsequent editions and came up to 645. The greatest Czech romantic poet, Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha also wrote many sonnets. In the second half of the 19th century Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd published Sonety samot\u00e1\u0159e (Sonnets of a Solitudinarian). Another poet, who wrote many sonnets was Josef Svatopluk Machar. He published \u010cty\u0159i knihy sonet\u016f (The Four Books of Sonnets). In the 20th century V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval wrote the cycle 100 sonet\u016f zachr\u00e1nkyni v\u011b\u010dn\u00e9ho studenta Roberta Davida (One Hundred Sonnets for the Woman who Rescued Perpetual Student Robert David). After the Second World War the sonnet was the favourite form of Old\u0159ich Vyhl\u00eddal. Czech poets use different metres for sonnets, Koll\u00e1r and M\u00e1cha used decasyllables, Vrchlick\u00fd iambic pentameter, Anton\u00edn Sova free verse, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten the Czech alexandrine. Ond\u0159ej Hanus wrote a monograph about Czech Sonnets in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\n\n== In Slovenian ==\n\nIn Slovenia the sonnet became a national verse form. The greatest Slovenian poet, France Pre\u0161eren, wrote many sonnets. His best known work worldwide is Sonetni venec (A Wreath of Sonnets), which is an example of crown of sonnets. Another work of his is the sequence Sonetje nesre\u010de (Sonnets of Misfortune). In writing sonnets Pre\u0161eren was followed by many later poets. After the Second World War sonnets remained very popular. Slovenian poets write both traditional rhymed sonnets and modern ones, unrhymed, in free verse. Among them are Milan Jesih and Ale\u0161 Debeljak. The metre for sonnets in Slovenian poetry is iambic pentameter with feminine rhymes, based both on the Italian endecasillabo and German iambic pentameter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAssociated formsFourteener (poetry)\nQuatorzain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nI.

        "wikipedia_content": "Tragedy (from the Greek: \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, trag\u014didia)  is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences.  While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term tragedy often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation.  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity\u2014\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\" as Raymond Williams puts it.From its origins in the theatre of ancient Greece 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Jean Racine, and Friedrich Schiller to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg; Samuel Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering; M\u00fcller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.  A long line of philosophers\u2014which includes Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Voltaire, Hume, Diderot, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Camus, Lacan, and Deleuze\u2014have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.In the wake of Aristotle's Poetics (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre.  Drama, in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialisation from the mid-19th century onwards. Both Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal define their epic theatre projects (non-Aristotelian drama and Theatre of the Oppressed, respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe word \"tragedy\" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from Classical Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, contracted from trag(o)-aoidi\u0101 = \"goat song\", which comes from tragos = \"he-goat\" and aeidein = \"to sing\" (cf. \"ode\"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize in a competition of choral dancing or was that around which a chorus danced prior to the animal's ritual sacrifice.  In another view on the etymology, Athenaeus of Naucratis (2nd\u20133rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was trygodia from trygos (grape harvest) and ode (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.Writing in 335 BCE (long after the Golden Age of 5th-century Athenian tragedy), Aristotle provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the dramatic art form in his Poetics, in which he argues that tragedy developed from the improvisations of the leader of choral dithyrambs (hymns sung and danced in praise of Dionysos, the god of wine and fertility):\nAnyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy\u2014tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature.\n\nIn the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:\n\nTragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief (catharsis) to such [and similar] emotions.\n\nThere is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing. A common descent from pre-Hellenic fertility and burial rites has been suggested. Friedrich Nietzsche discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book The Birth of Tragedy (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like satyrs in the original dithyrambs from which the tragic genre developed.\n\nScott Scullion writes:  There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as \"song for the prize goat\". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 (\"he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat\"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: \"Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat\" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: \"They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat\"...\n\n\n== Greek ==\n\nAthenian tragedy\u2014the oldest surviving form of tragedy\u2014is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period.  No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in the 5th century have survived.  We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a satyr play. The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the Oresteia of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant. The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an aulos) and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A Greek chorus danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe (\"turning, circling\"), antistrophe (\"counter-turning, counter-circling\") and epode (\"after-song\").\nMany ancient Greek tragedians employed the ekkykl\u00eama as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ekkykl\u00eama is after the murder of Agamemnon in the first play of Aeschylus' Oresteia, when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ekkykl\u00eama are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the mechane, which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase \"deus ex machina\" (\"god out of a machine\"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.\n\n\n== Roman ==\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509\u201327 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270\u2013240 BCE, Rome encountered Greek tragedy.  From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular Roman drama.  Livius Andronicus began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of Roman literature.  Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights\u2014Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius.From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive\u2014one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca.  Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his Phaedra, for example, was based on Euripides' Hippolytus.  Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the fabula praetexta (tragedies based on Roman subjects), Octavia, but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at elite gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective soliloquies. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of revenge, the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484\u20131558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.\n\n\n== Renaissance ==\n\n\n=== Influence of Greek and Roman ===\nClassical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. Medieval theatre was dominated by mystery plays, morality plays, farces and miracle plays. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the Paduan Lovato de' Lovati (1241\u20131309). His pupil Albertino Mussato (1261\u20131329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the Latin verse tragedy Eccerinis, which uses the story of the tyrant Ezzelino III da Romano to highlight the danger to Padua posed by Cangrande della Scala of Verona. It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the Achilles written before 1390 by Antonio Loschi of Vicenza (c.1365\u20131441) and the Progne of the Venetian Gregorio Correr (1409\u20131464) which dates from 1428\u201329.In 1515 Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478\u20131550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy Sophonisba in the vernacular that would later be called Italian. Drawn from Livy's account of Sophonisba, the Carthaginian princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the Oreste and Rosmunda of Trissino's friend, the Florentine Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai (1475\u20131525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, Rosmunda on the Hecuba of Euripides,  and Oreste on the Iphigenia in Tauris of the same author; like Sophonisba, they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) hendecasyllables. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is A Castro, by Portuguese poet and playwright Ant\u00f3nio Ferreira, written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of In\u00eas de Castro, one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: Pamfila or Filostrato e Panfila written in 1498 or 1508 by Antonio Cammelli (Antonio da Pistoia); and a Sophonisba by Galeotto del Carretto of 1502.From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of Sophocles, Seneca, and Euripides, as well as comedic writers such as Aristophanes, Terence and Plautus, were available in Europe and the next forty years saw humanists and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.\nThe most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of Seneca and the precepts of Horace and Aristotle (and contemporary commentaries by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Lodovico Castelvetro), although plots were taken from classical authors such as Plutarch, Suetonius, etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors (Sophocles and Euripides) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the Spanish Golden Age playwrights Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Lope de Vega, many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.\n\n\n=== Britain ===\n\nThe common forms are the:\n\nTragedy of circumstance: people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs\nTragedy of miscalculation: the protagonist's error of judgement has tragic consequences\nRevenge playIn English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of William Shakespeare and his Elizabethan contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\nCoriolanus\nHamlet\nJulius Caesar\nKing Lear\nMacbeth\nOthello\nRomeo and Juliet\nTimon of Athens\nTitus Andronicus\nTroilus and CressidaA contemporary of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:\n\nThe Tragical History of Doctor Faustus\nTamburlaine the GreatJohn Webster (1580?\u20131635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:\n\nThe Duchess of Malfi\nThe White Devil\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nContemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  Jacopo Peri, in the preface to his Euridice refers to \"the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage).\"  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of opera. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of Lully to about that of Gluck were not called opera, but trag\u00e9die en musique (\"tragedy in music\") or some similar name; the trag\u00e9die en musique is regarded as a distinct musical genre. Some later operatic composers have also shared Peri's aims: Richard Wagner's concept of Gesamtkunstwerk (\"integrated work of art\"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama. Nietzsche, in his The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.\n\n\n== Neo-classical ==\n\nFor much of the 17th century, Pierre Corneille, who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like Med\u00e9e (1635) and Le Cid (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of Le Cid was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:\n\nThe stage\u2014in both comedy and tragedy\u2014should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).\nTragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.\nAlthough Aristotle says that catharsis (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called \"heroic comedies\") and many continued to be successes, although the \"irregularities\" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9delin, abb\u00e9 d'Aubignac) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.\nJean Racine's tragedies\u2014inspired by Greek myths, Euripides, Sophocles and Seneca\u2014condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of pathos and amorous passion (like Ph\u00e8dre's love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays (\"Esther\" and \"Athalie\") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice, was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.\nFor more on French tragedy of the 16th and 17th centuries, see French Renaissance literature and French literature of the 17th century.\n\n\n== Bourgeois ==\n\nBourgeois tragedy (German: B\u00fcrgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the Enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, George Lillo's The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell, which was first performed in 1731. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play Miss Sara Sampson, which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest B\u00fcrgerliches Trauerspiel in Germany.\n\n\n== Modern development ==\nIn modernist literature, the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. Arthur Miller's essay \"Tragedy and the Common Man\" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings thus defining Domestic tragedies. British playwright Howard Barker has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume Arguments for a Theatre. \"You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool,\" he insists.Critics such as George Steiner have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In The Death of Tragedy (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that \u2018the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and \u201crealistic\u201d criteria.\u2019 In part, this feature of Shakespeare\u2019s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was \u2018so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.\u2019 When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare\u2019s forms are \u2018richer but hybrid'.Though rarer in modern day there are some who continue to embrace the genre of tragedy and have created many acclaimed works in the genre. An example of such a person is the Japanese writer Gen Urobuchi who has become world renowned for his tragic works, of which examples include Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero and Psycho-Pass. He himself acknowledges that he's a writer of tragedy and defines his work as such. He writes tragedies that derive from a variety of the classic traditions as well as modern takes on Shakespearean to Senecan to Greek tragedy. With Fate/Zero exemplifying the Greek model of tragedy. Modern day directors and writers cited the genre as an influence on their work, notable examples include Darren Aronofsky, Michael Haneke, Asghar Farhadi, David Simon, Kurt Sutter,  and Louis C.K.Numerous books and plays continue to be written in the tradition of tragedy to this day examples include Froth on the Daydream, The Road, The Fault in Our Stars, Fat City, Rabbit Hole, Death of a Salesman, Thirteen Reasons Why, Requiem for a Dream, Revolutionary Road.\n\n\n== Theories ==\n\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAristotle wrote in his work Poetics that\ntragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great person who experiences a reversal of fortune (Peripeteia). Aristotle's definition can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the Eumenides, but he says that the change from good to bad as in Oedipus Rex is preferable because this induces pity and fear within the spectators. Tragedy results in a catharsis (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.\nAccording to Aristotle, \"the structure of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing fear and pity\u2014for that is peculiar to this form of art.\"  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's hamartia, which is often translated as either a character flaw, or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to hamartanein, a sporting term that refers to an archer or spear-thrower missing his target). According to Aristotle, \"The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty.\"  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the law, the gods, fate, or society), but if a character\u2019s downfall is brought about by an external cause, Aristotle describes this as a misadventure and not a tragedy.In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition (anagnorisis--\"knowing again\" or \"knowing back\" or \"knowing throughout\") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition \"a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate.\"\nIn Poetics, Aristotle gave the following definition in ancient Greek of the word \"tragedy\" (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1):\"\u1f1c\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c7\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u1f21\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u1ff3 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u1ff3 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b4\u03b9\u1fbd \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b9\u1fbd \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.\"\nwhich means Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.\nCommon usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an Aristotelian tragedy the story must fit the set of requirements as laid out by Poetics.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions \u2014 psychological or religious \u2014 which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.  Exactly what constitutes a \"tragedy\", however, is a frequently debated matter.\nAccording to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:\n1. Complex, which involves Peripety and Discovery\n2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions\n3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and Peleus\n4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are Phorcides and Prometheus\n\n\n=== Hegel ===\nG.W.F. Hegel, the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to epistemology and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay \"Hegel's Theory of Tragedy,\" A.C. Bradley first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the \"tragic collision\", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the \"tragic hero\" and his or her \"hamartia\" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone. Hegel himself, however, in his seminal \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:\n\nThe heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [gleichberechtigt] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...\nHegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: \"Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside.\"\n\n\n== Similar dramatic forms in world theatre ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Indian drama ===\nThe writer Bharata Muni, in his work on dramatic theory A Treatise on Theatre (Sanskrit: N\u0101tya\u015b\u0101stra, \u0928\u093e\u091f\u094d\u092f \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930, c. 200 BCE \u2013 200 CE), identified several rasas (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the Sanskrit drama of ancient India. The text also suggests the notion of musical modes or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as ragas. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes gandhara or rishabha are said to provoke \"sadness\" or \"pathos\" (karuna rasa) whereas rishabha evokes heroism (vira rasa). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text Dattilam, composed around the same time as the Treatise.\nThe celebrated ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata, can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to Hermann Oldenberg, the original epic once carried an immense \"tragic force\".  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the Mahabharata into dramatic form.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nClassicism\nTrag\u00e9dies en musique\nShe-tragedy\nRevenge tragedy\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTragedy on In Our Time at the BBC\nTaplin, Oliver; Billings, Joshua. \"What is Tragedy?\" (podcast).

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshat",
        "wikipedia_content": "Peshat (also P'shat, \u05e4\u05e9\u05d8) is one of four classical methods of Jewish biblical exegesis used by rabbis and Jewish bible scholars in reading the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh. It is the first of the four exegetical methods known together as PaRDeS. While Peshat is commonly defined as referring to the surface or literal (direct) meaning of a text, numerous scholars and rabbis have debated this for centuries, giving Peshat many uses and definitions.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nPeshat, among the four methods which make up Pardes, is most often defined as \"straight,\" in reference to its tendency to describe the meaning of the text apparent at face value, taking into account idiomatic expressions, and focusing mostly on literal interpretation. It is often considered the most straightforward method for reading and understanding of biblical text. In this way, Peshat differentiates itself from the other methods present in Pardes - Drash, Remez, and Sod, which look at what may be hidden in the text.\nLinguistically, the term Peshat finds its root in the Biblical Hebrew term meaning \"to flatten out,\" or \"to extend.\" In the Talmudic Era, this definition was expanded to mean \"to propound.\" Often when defining Peshat, a quote from the Shabbat tractate of Talmud is referenced, stating \"\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5,\" or, \"a text cannot be taken from the meaning of its peshat.\" Some have used the Talmudic definition of Peshat to widen its overall definition, stating that the Peshat interpretation of a particular passage is \"the teaching recognized by the public as obviously authoritative, since familiar and traditional,\" or \"the usual accepted traditional meaning as it was generally taught.\" Based on the definitions provided by Talmud, it may be inferred that Peshat is solely a literal exegetical method. Others, though, have attributed this line of thought to the work of Rashi, and that he strictly defined Peshat and Drash years later - often his definitions have been used to redact the meaning of Peshat within its Talmudic usage.Another linguistic curiosity can be seen in the difference between Peshat and the Hebrew verb Lamad (\u05dc\u05de\u05d3), meaning \"to study.\" Peshat can be interpreted to mean a thorough and intensive learning of a text, rather than just a surface reading signified by Lamad. In this understanding of Peshat, the idea that it is only the literal meaning of a text is incorrect. Rather, Peshat would refer to what can be extracted from intensive study, while still maintaining the importance of the literal meaning of the text. Therefore, a slightly different definition of Peshat can be formed, specifically that Peshat should refer to the meaning of a text as was commonly taught and accepted, including, but not limited to, a literal interpretation.Definitions of Peshat also note the importance of context, both historical and literary. This is in contrast to Drash, which will often take the text of a verse out of its context, for uses beyond the context such as ritual or moral purposes. However, this does not mean that Peshat and Drash are fully opposing methods. In fact, one may often be used in helping to explain the other, in finding and defining nuances in text that might be otherwise inexplicable without application of both methods.\n\n\n== Rabbinic views and usage ==\nAbraham Ibn Ezra is quoted in his writings as saying that the Rabbis of the Talmud were well-versed in Peshat, having built their Midrashic exegeses on it: \"They [the talmudic rabbis] knew peshat better than all the generations that came after them.\" In contrast, Rashbam, felt that the early rabbis were not knowledgeable in Peshat, and instead used other strategies. Consequently, these rabbis were led to opposing conclusions of the rabbis' halachic exegesis: Rashbam understood this as a separate type of exegesis from Peshat, while Ibn Ezra felt that the only proper exegesis would lead to his own conclusions, and therefore disregarded the midrashim of the Talmudic Rabbis as exegesis altogether. Regardless of these differences in opinion in reference to the Rabbis of the Talmud, both Ibn Ezra and Rashbam favored and promoted Peshat as a superior alternative to Midrashic methods.One of Rashbam's students, Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency, is noted as completely removing Drash from his exegetical strategies, relying solely on Peshat. In comparison to Rashbam's tendency to explain how his views would contrast with those of Talmudic Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer is not compelled to do so, feeling that Peshat is the only proper way to look at text. As Peshat's methods rely often on the importance of context, Rabbi Eliezer's commentaries are known for their tendency to focus on the context of a given verse or text. His commentaries are integrated with text, rather than sitting separate from them, and he insists on ensuring that no verse loses its context during his discussions, in comparison to other methods, such as the \"verse-by-verse approach of Rashi\"David Kimhi (Radak) was also known for his ability in Peshat, and was influenced both by Ibn Ezra and Rashi. While Kimhi preferred Peshat methods over Derash, the influence of Rashi can be seen in some of his commentaries, in the inclusion of midrashic citations. Additionally, Kimhi lived among many famed proponents of Derash, such as Rabbi Moses the Preacher, who \"undoubtedly had a substantial impact on Radak.\" Kimhi tended to go out of his way to reject the views of the Rabbis of the Talmud often, which has led to the theory that, although disagreeing with them, Kimhi fully acknowledged the tradition and authority of the Talmud Rabbis. In his commentaries, Kimhi labels his interpretation as Peshat, and that of the Talmudic Rabbis as Derash, creating a strict divide between the two in his writings.A student of Saadiah Gaon is recorded as saying: \"This is the sign by which you should know which comments well and which comments badly: Any commentator who first comments with peshuto shel mikra in concise language, and afterwards brings some of our rabbis' midrash, this is a good commentary, and the reverse is [a] crude [commentary].\n\n\n== Talmudic examples ==\nBelow are several examples of Peshat's usage in the Talmud:\n\nR. Kahana objected to Mar son of R. Huna: But this refers to the words of the Torah? A verse cannot depart from its plain meaning (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5), he replied. R. Kahana said: By the time I was eighteen years old I had studied the whole Talmud, yet I did not know that a verse cannot depart from its plain meaning (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5) until today. What does he inform us? That a man should study and subsequently understand. Others say: According to the Rabbis no question arises, for since the text has once been torn away from its ordinary meaning (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5) it must in all respects so remain.Said Raba: Although throughout the Torah no text loses its ordinary meaning (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5), here the gezerah shawah has come and entirely deprived the text of its ordinary meaning (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPardes (Jewish exegesis)\nRabbinic Literature\nTorah Study\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAngel, Rabbi Hayyim. \"From Black Fire to White Fire: Conversations about Religious Tanakh Methodology.\" The Institute for Jewish Ideas and Ideals. 4 Sept. 2008.

        "wikipedia_content": "Mesopotamia  is a historical region of Western Asia situated within the Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system, in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq, Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish\u2013Syrian and Iran\u2013Iraq borders.The Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians and Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.\nAround 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control. In AD 226, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians. The division of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from AD 395) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines. A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy and agriculture\".\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe regional toponym Mesopotamia (, Ancient Greek: \u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \"[land] between rivers\"; Arabic: \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0641\u062f\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u200e bil\u0101d ar-r\u0101fidayn; Persian: \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0631\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646\u200e miy\u0101n rud\u0101n; Syriac: \u0712\u071d\u072c \u0722\u0717\u072a\u071d\u0722\u200e Beth Nahrain \"land of rivers\")  comes from the ancient Greek root words \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (mesos) \"middle\" and \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (potamos) \"river\" and translates to  \"(Land) between two/the rivers\". It is used throughout the Greek Septuagint (c. 250 BC) to translate the Hebrew and Aramaic equivalent Naharaim. An even earlier Greek usage of the name Mesopotamia is evident from The Anabasis of Alexander, which was written in the late 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great. In the Anabasis, Mesopotamia was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in north Syria.\nThe Aramaic term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept. Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern Turkey. The neighbouring steppes to the west of the Euphrates and the western part of the Zagros Mountains are also often included under the wider term Mesopotamia.A further distinction is usually made between Northern or Upper Mesopotamia and Southern or Lower Mesopotamia. Upper Mesopotamia, also known as the Jazira, is the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris from their sources down to Baghdad. Lower Mesopotamia is the area from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf and includes Kuwait and parts of western Iran.In modern academic usage, the term Mesopotamia often also has a chronological connotation. It is usually used to designate the area until the Muslim conquests, with names like Syria, Jazira, and Iraq being used to describe the region after that date. It has been argued that these later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMesopotamia encompasses the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, both of which have their headwaters in the Taurus Mountains. Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region. Overland routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult. The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way to a 15,000-square-kilometre (5,800 sq mi) region of marshes, lagoons, mud flats, and reed banks in the south. In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the Persian Gulf.\nThe arid environment which ranges from the northern areas of rain-fed agriculture to the south where irrigation of agriculture is essential if a surplus energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) is to be obtained. This irrigation is aided by a high water table and by melting snows from the high peaks of the northern Zagros Mountains and from the Armenian Highlands, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that give the region its name. The usefulness of irrigation depends upon the ability to mobilize sufficient labor for the construction and maintenance of canals, and this, from the earliest period, has assisted the development of urban settlements and centralized systems of political authority.\nAgriculture throughout the region has been supplemented by nomadic pastoralism, where tent-dwelling nomads herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the river pastures in the dry summer months, out into seasonal grazing lands on the desert fringe in the wet winter season. The area is generally lacking in building stone, precious metals and timber, and so historically has relied upon long-distance trade of agricultural products to secure these items from outlying areas. In the marshlands to the south of the area, a complex water-borne fishing culture has existed since prehistoric times, and has added to the cultural mix.\nPeriodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons. The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur. Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems. Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city states has meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units. These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe pre-history of the Ancient Near East begins in the Lower Paleolithic period. Therein, writing emerged with a pictographic script in the Uruk IV period (c. 4th millennium BC), and the documented record of actual historical events \u2014 and the ancient history of lower Mesopotamia \u2014 commenced in the mid-third millennium BC with cuneiform records of early dynastic kings. This entire prehistory ends with either the arrival of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 6th century BC, or with the Muslim conquest and the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, from which point the region came to be known as Iraq. In the long span of this period, Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly developed and socially complex states.\nThe region was one of the four riverine civilizations where writing was invented, along with the Nile valley in Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yellow River in China. Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, Assur and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Eridu, the Akkadian kingdoms, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the various Assyrian empires. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon of Akkad (who established the Akkadian Empire), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), Ashur-uballit II and Tiglath-Pileser I (who established the Assyrian Empire).\nScientists analysed DNA from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in Germany. They compared the genetic signatures to those of modern populations and found similarities with the DNA of people living in today's Turkey and Iraq.\n\n\n=== Periodization ===\nPre- and protohistory\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (10,000\u20138700 BC)\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (8700\u20136800)\nJarmo (7500-5000 BC)\nHassuna (~6000 BC\u2013?

Along with Sumerian, Semitic languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia. Subartuan a language of the Zagros, perhaps related to the Hurro-Urartuan language family is attested in personal names, rivers and mountains and in various crafts. Akkadian came to be the dominant language during the Akkadian Empire and the Assyrian empires, but Sumerian was retained for administrative, religious, literary and scientific purposes. Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babylonian period. Old Aramaic, which had already become common in Mesopotamia, then became the official provincial administration language of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and then the Achaemenid Empire: the official lect is called Imperial Aramaic. Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries. The last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.\nEarly in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language. Cuneiform literally means \"wedge-shaped\", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay. The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms. The earliest texts (7 archaic tablets) come from the \u00c9, a temple dedicated to the goddess Inanna at Uruk, from a building labeled as Temple C by its excavators.\nThe early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus, only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its use. It was not until the widespread use of a syllabic script was adopted under Sargon's rule that significant portions of the Mesopotamian population became literate. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated.\nDuring the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerian and the Akkadian language users, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nLibraries were extant in towns and temples during the Babylonian Empire. An old Sumerian proverb averred that \"he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn.\" Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary.\nA considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up.\nMany Babylonian literary works are still studied today. One of the most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh. The whole story is a composite product, although it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\n\n=== Mathematics ===\n\nMesopotamian mathematics and science was based on a sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system. This is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-degree circle. The Sumerian calendar was based on the seven-day week. This form of mathematics was instrumental in early map-making. The Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if pi were fixed at 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the area of the base and the height; however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used pi as 25/8 (3.125 instead of 3.14159~). The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven modern miles (11 km). This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.\n\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n\nFrom Sumerian times, temple priesthoods had attempted to associate current events with certain positions of the planets and stars. This continued to Assyrian times, when Limmu lists were created as a year by year association of events with planetary positions, which, when they have survived to the present day, allow accurate associations of relative with absolute dating for establishing the history of Mesopotamia.\nThe Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict eclipses and solstices. Scholars thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy. Most of these related to religion and omens. Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon. They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter. The origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.\nDuring the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution. This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.\nIn Seleucid and Parthian times, the astronomical reports were thoroughly scientific; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the history of astronomy.\nThe only Greek-Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a heliocentric model of planetary motion was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC). Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch. He supported Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric theory where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun. According to Plutarch, Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used (except that he correctly theorized on tides as a result of Moon's attraction).\nBabylonian astronomy served as the basis for much of Greek, classical Indian, Sassanian, Byzantine, Syrian, medieval Islamic, Central Asian, and Western European astronomy.\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe oldest Babylonian texts on medicine date back to the Old Babylonian period in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the Diagnostic Handbook written by the umm\u00e2n\u016b, or chief scholar, Esagil-kin-apli of Borsippa, during the reign of the Babylonian king Adad-apla-iddina (1069-1046 BC).Along with contemporary Egyptian medicine, the Babylonians introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and prescriptions. In addition, the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of therapy and aetiology and the use of empiricism, logic, and rationality in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical symptoms and often detailed empirical observations along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis.The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages, creams and pills. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on exorcism to cleanse the patient from any curses. Esagil-kin-apli's Diagnostic Handbook was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's disease, its aetiology, its future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.Esagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his Diagnostic Handbook. These include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nMesopotamian people invented many technologies including metal and copper-working, glass and lamp making, textile weaving, flood control, water storage, and irrigation. They were also one of the first Bronze Age societies in the world. They developed from copper, bronze, and gold on to iron. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and maces.\nAccording to a recent hypothesis, the Archimedes' screw may have been used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BC, although mainstream scholarship holds it to be a Greek invention of later times. Later, during the Parthian or Sasanian periods, the Baghdad Battery, which may have been the world's first battery, was created in Mesopotamia.\n\n\n== Religion and philosophy ==\n\nAncient Mesopotamian religion was the first recorded. Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat disc, surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, heaven. They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the universe was born from this enormous sea. In addition, Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic. Although the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations. The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki. Their son was Enlil, the air god. They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god. He was the chief god of the pantheon. The Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?. They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nThe numerous civilizations of the area influenced the Abrahamic religions, especially the Hebrew Bible; its cultural values and literary influence are especially evident in the Book of Genesis.Giorgio Buccellati believes that the origins of philosophy can be traced back to early Mesopotamian wisdom, which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly ethics, in the forms of dialectic, dialogues, epic poetry, folklore, hymns, lyrics, prose works, and proverbs. Babylonian reason and rationality developed beyond empirical observation.The earliest form of logic was developed by the Babylonians, notably in the rigorous nonergodic nature of their social systems. Babylonian thought was axiomatic and is comparable to the \"ordinary logic\" described by John Maynard Keynes. Babylonian thought was also based on an open-systems ontology which is compatible with ergodic axioms. Logic was employed to some extent in Babylonian astronomy and medicine.\nBabylonian thought had a considerable influence on early Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. In particular, the Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the Sophists, the Heraclitean doctrine of dialectic, and the dialogs of Plato, as well as a precursor to the Socratic method. The Ionian philosopher Thales was influenced by Babylonian cosmological ideas.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAncient Mesopotamians had ceremonies each month. The theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:\n\nThe Lunar phase (a waxing moon meant abundance and growth, while a waning moon was associated with decline, conservation, and festivals of the Underworld)\nThe phase of the annual agricultural cycle\nEquinoxes and solstices\nThe local mythos and its divine Patrons\nThe success of the reigning Monarch\nThe Akitu, or New Year Festival (First full moon after spring equinox)\nCommemoration of specific historical events (founding, military victories, temple holidays, etc.)\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nSome songs were written for the gods but many were written to describe important events. Although music and songs amused kings, they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the marketplaces. Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children. Thus songs were passed on through many generations as an oral tradition until writing was more universal. These songs provided a means of passing on through the centuries highly important information about historical events.\nThe Oud (Arabic:\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u062f) is a small, stringed musical instrument used by the Mesopotamians. The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago. It is on a cylinder seal currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon. The image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing right-handed. This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient Egypt from the 18th dynasty onwards in long- and short-neck varieties. The oud is regarded as a precursor to the European lute. Its name is derived from the Arabic word \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u062f al-\u2018\u016bd 'the wood', which is probably the name of the tree from which the oud was made. (The Arabic name, with the definite article, is the source of the word 'lute'.)\n\n\n=== Games ===\nHunting was popular among Assyrian kings. Boxing and wrestling feature frequently in art, and some form of polo was probably popular, with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses. They also played majore, a game similar to the sport rugby, but played with a ball made of wood. They also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, now known as the \"Royal Game of Ur\".\n\n\n=== Family life ===\n\nMesopotamia, as shown by successive law codes, those of Urukagina, Lipit Ishtar and Hammurabi, across its history became more and more a patriarchal society, one in which the men were far more powerful than the women. For example, during the earliest Sumerian period, the \"en\", or high priest of male gods was originally a woman, that of female goddesses, a man.  Thorkild Jacobsen, as well as many others, has suggested that early Mesopotamian society was ruled by a \"council of elders\" in which men and women were equally represented, but that over time, as the status of women fell, that of men increased. As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, went to school. Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade. Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children. Some children would help with crushing grain or cleaning birds. Unusually for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had rights. They could own property and, if they had good reason, get a divorce.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nHundreds of graves have been excavated in parts of Mesopotamia, revealing information about Mesopotamian burial habits. In the city of Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions. A few have been found wrapped in mats and carpets. Deceased children were put in big \"jars\" which were placed in the family chapel. Other remains have been found buried in common city graveyards. 17 graves have been found with very precious objects in them. It is assumed that these were royal graves.  Rich of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun.\n\n\n== Economy and agriculture ==\n\nIrrigated agriculture spread southwards from the Zagros foothills with the Samara and Hadji Muhammed culture, from about 5,000 BC. Sumerian temples functioned as banks and developed the first large-scale system of loans and credit, but the Babylonians developed the earliest system of commercial banking. It was comparable in some ways to modern post-Keynesian economics, but with a more \"anything goes\" approach.In the early period down to Ur III temples owned up to one third of the available land, declining over time as royal and other private holdings increased in frequency.  The word Ensi was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture. Villeins are known to have worked most frequently within agriculture, especially in the grounds of temples or palaces.The geography of southern Mesopotamia is such that agriculture is possible only with irrigation and good drainage, a fact which has had a profound effect on the evolution of early Mesopotamian civilization. The need for irrigation led the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers. Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, took root on tributaries of the Euphrates, while others, notably Lagash, were built on branches of the Tigris. The rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials). With irrigation, the food supply in Mesopotamia was comparable to the Canadian prairies.The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent, which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile. Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops, portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable. This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia. Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts. Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley, onions, grapes, turnips, and apples. Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine. As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian, farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them, but there were some exceptions. There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical (i.e. the escape/mutiny of the slave). Although the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities. The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept.  Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils, leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad, further north.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe geography of Mesopotamia had a profound impact on the political development of the region. Among the rivers and streams, the Sumerian people built the first cities along with irrigation canals which were separated by vast stretches of open desert or swamp where nomadic tribes roamed. Communication among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous. Thus, each Sumerian city became a city-state, independent of the others and protective of its independence. At times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries. As a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare. Eventually Sumer was unified by Eannatum, but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later. The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings. The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations.\n\n\n=== Kings ===\n\nThe Mesopotamians believed their kings and queens were descended from the City of Gods, but, unlike the ancient Egyptians, they never believed their kings were real gods. Most kings named themselves \u201cking of the universe\u201d or \u201cgreat king\u201d. Another common name was \u201cshepherd\u201d, as kings had to look after their people.\n\n\n=== Power ===\nWhen Assyria grew into an empire, it was divided into smaller parts, called provinces. Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad. They all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes. Governors also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built. He was also responsible for enforcing the laws. In this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire. Although Babylon was quite a small state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of Hammurabi's rule. He was known as \u201cthe law maker\u201d, and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia. It was later called Babylonia, which meant \"the gateway of the gods.\" It also became one of history's greatest centers of learning.\n\n\n=== Warfare ===\n\nWith the end of the Uruk phase, walled cities grew and many isolated Ubaid villages were abandoned indicating a rise in communal violence.  An early king Lugalbanda was supposed to have built the white walls around the city.  As city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals. These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major war\u2014the first recording of a war occurred around 3200 BC but was not common until about 2500 BC. An Early Dynastic II king (Ensi) of Uruk in Sumer, Gilgamesh (c. 2600 BC), was commended for military exploits against Humbaba guardian of the Cedar Mountain, and was later celebrated in many later poems and songs in which he was claimed to be two-thirds god and only one-third human. The later Stele of the Vultures at the end of the Early Dynastic III period  (2600\u20132350 BC), commemorating the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over the neighbouring rival city of Umma is the oldest monument in the world that celebrates a massacre. From this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system. At times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities. This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states. When empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries. King Sargon, for example, conquered all the cities of Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern Syria. Many Assyrian and Babylonian palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the enemy either desperately escaping or hiding amongst reeds.\n\n\n=== Laws ===\n\nCity-states of Mesopotamia created the first law codes, drawn from legal precedence and decisions made by kings.  The codes of Urukagina and Lipit Ishtar have been found.  The most renowned of these was that of Hammurabi, as mentioned above, who was posthumously famous for his set of laws, the Code of Hammurabi (created c. 1780 BC), which is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient Mesopotamia. He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia.  Examination of the laws show a progressive weakening of the rights of women, and increasing severity in the treatment of slaves\n\n\n== Art ==\n\nThe art of Mesopotamia rivalled that of Ancient Egypt as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western Eurasia from the 4th millennium BC until the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculpture was also painted.\nThe Protoliterate period, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals.  The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000\u20132800 BC, part man and part lion. A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived.  Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men.  Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a Ram in a Thicket, the Copper Bull and a bull's head on one of the Lyres of Ur.From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not. The Burney Relief is an unusual elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15 inches) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions.  It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded.  Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, often the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available archaeological evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well. Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.\nBrick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities. The ziggurat is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the Ishtar Gate from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\nThe most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at Uruk from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the Early Dynastic period sites in the Diyala River valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the Third Dynasty of Ur remains at Nippur (Sanctuary of Enlil) and Ur (Sanctuary of Nanna), Middle Bronze Age remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of Ebla, Mari, Alalakh, Aleppo and Kultepe, Late Bronze Age palaces at Bogazkoy (Hattusha), Ugarit, Ashur and Nuzi, Iron Age palaces and temples at Assyrian (Kalhu/Nimrud, Khorsabad, Nineveh), Babylonian (Babylon), Urartian (Tushpa/Van,  Kalesi, Cavustepe, Ayanis, Armavir, Erebuni, Bastam) and Neo-Hittite sites (Karkamis, Tell Halaf, Karatepe). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the Iron Age.\n\n\n== See Also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nFrankfort, Henri, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), ISBN 0-14-056107-2\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAtlas de la M\u00e9sopotamie et du Proche-Orient ancien, Brepols, 1996 ISBN 2-503-50046-3.\nBenoit, Agn\u00e8s; 2003.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game",
        "wikipedia_content": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combine core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres.\nWith the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity, the use of the term (and the hybrid term \"action-adventure\") has been more liberal. It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term \"adventure\" or \"action\" to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs, and not the gameplay itself.\nAction-adventure is a hybrid genre, and thus the definition is very inclusive, leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games, and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres. Typically, pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve, with very little or no action. If there is action, it is generally confined to isolated minigames. Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes. Therefore, action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving, in both violent and non-violent situations.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nAn action-adventure game can be defined as a game with a mix of elements from an action game and an adventure game, especially crucial elements like puzzles. Action-adventures require many of the same physical skills as action games, but also offer a storyline, numerous characters, an inventory system, dialogue, and other features of adventure games. They are faster-paced than pure adventure games, because they include both physical and conceptual challenges. Action-adventure games normally include a combination of complex story elements, which are displayed for players using audio and video. The story is heavily reliant upon the player character's movement, which triggers story events and thus affects the flow of the game. Some examples of action-adventure games include The Legend of Zelda, God of War, and Tomb Raider series.Exactly when a game stops being an adventure game and becomes an action game is a matter of interpretation. There are quite a few disagreements in the community and in the media over what actually constitutes an action-adventure game. One definition of the term \"action adventure\" may be '\"An action/adventure game is a game that has enough action in it not to be called an adventure game, but not enough action to be called an action game.\" In some cases an action game with puzzles will be classified as an action-adventure game, but if these puzzles are quite simple they might be classified as an action game. Others see action games as a pure genre, while an action-adventure is an action game that includes situational problem-solving. Adventure gamers may also be purists, rejecting any game that makes use of physical challenges or time pressure. Regardless, the action-adventure label is prominent in articles over the internet and media. The term \"action-adventure\" is usually substituted for a particular subgenre due to its wide scope.\n\n\n== Subgenres ==\nAlthough action-adventure games are diverse and difficult to classify, there are some distinct subgenres. Popular subgenres include:\n\nFirst-person action-adventure, which make use of first-person shooter gameplay, forgoing constant action in favor of important adventure game elements such as environmental problem-solving and a complex plot. Notable examples of this include Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, Dishonored, and Far Cry 3.\nThird-person action-adventure, in which gameplay is in the third-person. Notable examples include games like the Tomb Raider series, The Legend of Zelda series, the Grand Theft Auto series, the Hitman series and the Uncharted series.\nImmersive sim, typically games played from the first-person perspective that include elements of role-playing, stealth, and platform games that create numerous gameplay systems that the player can use to complete objectives in many different manners, creating a sense of player agency and emergent gameplay.\nPlatform-adventure games, which emphasize both exploration and puzzle solving, but also feature traditional platform game conventions. Examples of games of this type include the Tomb Raider series and the Metroid and Castlevania games; the term \"Metroidvania\" is derived from these latter two and used to describe games in this genre that generally are based on two-dimensional platformers.\nIsometric platform-adventure, which feature freely explorable environments with three-dimensional gameplay and two-dimensional graphics using an isometric projection.\nStealth games, which emphasize avoiding detection by enemies rather than engaging them in direct combat, leading to a greater emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving than other types of action games. Notable examples include the Metal Gear series, the Assassin's Creed series, the Splinter Cell series and the Hitman series.\nSurvival horror, which emphasize \"inventory management\" and making sure the player has enough ammunition and recovery items to \"survive\" the horror setting. Survival-horror is a thematic genre with diverse gameplay, however, so not all survival horror games share these features. The Resident Evil, State Of Decay and Silent Hill franchises popularized this subgenre and stand to date as the most popular franchises of its kind.\nSurvival games, which have open-ended survival without the supernatural elements that can be found in survival horror games.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nAction-adventure games are faster paced than pure adventure games, and include physical as well as conceptual challenges where the story is enacted rather than narrated. While motion-based, often reflexive, actions are required, the gameplay still follows a number of adventure game genre tropes (gathering items, exploration of and interaction with one's environment, often including an overworld connecting areas of importance, and puzzle-solving). While the controls are arcade-style (character movement, few action commands) there is an ultimate goal beyond a high score. In most action-adventure games, the player controls a single avatar as the protagonist. This type of game is often quite similar to role-playing video games.They are distinct from graphic adventures, which sometimes have free-moving central characters, but also wider variety of commands and fewer or no action game elements and are distinct too from text adventures, characterized by many different commands introduced by the user via a complex text parser and no free-moving character. While they share general gameplay dynamics, action-adventures vary widely in the design of their viewpoints, including bird's eye, side scrolling, first-person, third-person, over-the-shoulder, or even a 3/4 isometric view.\nMany action-adventure games simulate a conversation through a conversation tree. When the player encounters a non-player character, they are allowed to select a choice of what to say. The NPC gives a scripted response to the player, and the game offers the player several new ways to respond.\nDue to the action-adventure subgenre's broad inclusive nature it causes some players to having difficulty finishing a particular game. To compensate for this lack of the player's ability, companies have devised ways to give the player help, such as helpful clues, or allowing them to skip puzzles outright.\n\n\n== History ==\nBrett Weiss cites Superman (1979) as an action-adventure game, with Retro Gamer crediting it as the \"first to utilize multiple screens as playing area\".  Mark J.P. Wolf credits Adventure (1980) as the earliest-known action-adventure game, was an adaptation of text-based adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure for the Atari 2600, with the player having the ability to fight in combat like in an action game. Castle Wolfenstein (1981) was another early action-adventure game. Allgame also claimed the following titles released prior to 1982 were action-adventure games: Rescue at Rigel (1980), Quest for the Rings (1981), and Venture (1981).According to Wizardry developer Roe R. Adams, early action-adventure games \"were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting,\" citing Castlevania (1986), Trojan (1986) and Wizards & Warriors (1987) as examples.Although noting some similarity to Adventure, IGN UK argues that The Legend of Zelda (1986) \"helped to establish a new subgenre of action-adventure\", becoming a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, adventure-style inventory puzzles, an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the experience points. The Legend of Zelda was the most prolific action-adventure game series through to the 2000s.Games like Brain Breaker (1985), Xanadu (1985), Metroid (1986) and Vampire Killer (1986) combined a side-scrolling platformer format with adventure exploration, creating the Metroidvania platform-adventure subgenre. Similarly, games like 005,  Castle Wolfenstein and Metal Gear (1987) combined action-adventure exploration with stealth mechanics, laying the foundations for the stealth game subgenre, which would later be popularized in 1998 by Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, and Thief: The Dark Project.\nThe cinematic platformer Prince of Persia (1989) featured action-adventure elements, inspiring games such as Another World (1991) and Flashback (1992). Alone in the Dark (1992) featured the use of 3D graphics, which would later be popularized by Resident Evil (1996) and Tomb Raider (1996). Resident Evil in particular created the survival horror subgenre, inspiring titles such as Silent Hill (1999) and Fatal Frame (2001). Action-adventure games have gone on to become more popular than the pure adventure games and pure platform action games that inspired them.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Video games portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="

        "label": "Western literature",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_fiction",
        "wikipedia_content": "Western fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West frontier and typically set from the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century. Well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey from the early 20th century and Louis L'Amour from the mid 20th century. The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the popularity of televised Westerns such as Bonanza.  Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and has reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside a few west American states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-1850s ===\nThe predecessor of the western in American literature emerged early with tales of the frontier. The most famous of the early 19th century frontier novels were James Fenimore Cooper's five novels comprising the Leatherstocking Tales.  Cooper's novels were largely set in what was at the time the American frontier: the Appalachian Mountains and areas west of there.  As did his novel The Prairie (1824), most later westerns would typically take place west of the Mississippi River.\n\n\n=== 1850s\u20131900 ===\nThe Western as a specialized genre got its start in the \"penny dreadfuls\" and later the \"dime novels\".  Published in June 1860, Malaeska; the Indian Wife of the White Hunter is considered the first dime novel. These cheaply made books were hugely successful and capitalized on the many stories that were being told about the mountain men, outlaws, settlers, and lawmen who were taming the western frontier. Many of these novels were fictionalized stories based on actual people, such as Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp (who was still alive at the time), Wild Bill Hickok, and Jesse James.\n\n\n=== 1900s\u20131930s ===\nBy 1900, the new medium of pulp magazines helped to relate these adventures to easterners.  Meanwhile, non-American authors, like the German Karl May, picked up the genre, went to full novel length, and made it hugely popular and successful in continental Europe from about 1880 on, though they were generally dismissed as trivial by the literary critics of the day.Popularity grew with the publication of Owen Wister's novel The Virginian (1902) and especially Zane Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage (1912).  The first Hopalong Cassidy stories by Clarence Mulford appeared in 1904, both as dime novels and in pulp magazines.  When pulp magazines exploded in popularity in the 1920s, Western fiction greatly benefited (as did the author Max Brand, who excelled at the western short story).  Pulp magazines that specialised in Westerns include Cowboy Stories, Ranch Romances, Star Western, West, and Western Story Magazine. The simultaneous popularity of Western movies in the 1920s also helped the genre.\n\n\n=== 1940s\u20131960s ===\nIn the 1940s several seminal Westerns were published, including The Ox-Bow Incident (1940) by Walter van Tilburg Clark, The Big Sky (1947) and The Way West (1949) by A.B. Guthrie, Jr., and Shane (1949) by Jack Schaefer.  Many other Western authors gained readership in the 1950s, such as Ray Hogan, Louis L'Amour, and Luke Short.\nThe genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on television. The burnout of the American public on television Westerns in the late 1960s seemed to have an effect on the literature as well, and interest in Western literature began to wane.\n\n\n==== Western comics ====\n\nWestern novels, films and pulps gave birth to Western comics, which were very popular, particularly from the late 1940s until circa 1967, when the comics began to turn to reprints. This can particularly be seen at Marvel Comics, where Westerns began circa 1948 and thrived until 1967, when one of their flagship titles, Kid Colt Outlaw (1949\u20131979), ceased to have new stories and entered the reprint phase. Other notable long-running Marvel Western comics included Rawhide Kid (1955\u20131957, 1960\u20131979) Two-Gun Kid (1948\u20131962), and Marvel Wild Western (1948\u20131957).\nDC Comics published the long-running series  All-Star Western (1951\u20131961) and Western Comics (1948\u20131961), and Charlton Comics published Billy the Kid (1957\u20131983) and Cheyenne Kid (1957\u20131973). Magazine Enterprises' Straight Arrow ran from 1950 to 1956, and Prize Comics' Prize Comics Western ran from 1948 to 1956.\nFawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including Hopalong Cassidy from 1948 to 1953. They also published comics starring actors known for their Western roles, including Tom Mix Western (1948\u20131953) and Gabby Hayes Western (1948\u20131953). Similarly, Dell Comics published Roy Rogers comics from 1948 to 1961, and Magazine Enterprises published Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid from 1949 to 1955.\nThe popular Western comic strip Red Ryder was syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers from 1938 to 1964.\n\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\nIn the 1970s, the work of Louis L'Amour began to catch hold of most western readers and he has tended to dominate the western reader lists ever since. George G. Gilman also maintained a cult following for several years in the 1970s and 1980s. Larry McMurtry's and Cormac McCarthy's works remain notable.  Specifically, McMurtry's Lonesome Dove and McCarthy's Blood Meridian (both published in 1985) are recognized as major masterpieces both within and beyond the genre. Elmer Kelton, mostly noted for his novels The Good Old Boys and The Time it Never Rained, was voted by the Western Writers of America as the \"Best Western Writer of All Time\". Early in the 1970s Indiana novelist Marilyn Durham wrote two popular Western novels, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing and Dutch Uncle.  \nWestern readership as a whole began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s. A partial exception was an innovation, the so-called \"adult western\". As one practitioner puts it, \"What's an Adult Western? It's a western novel with sex in it. That's right, the cowboy has sex with women. A new idea? Probably not, but heretofore this had not been seen in western novels (certainly not by Max Brand, Zane Grey, Owen Wister or Louis L'Amour). What these books actually showed was that men and women really did have sex in the old west. (Back when I started the series a rigidly traditional western writer of my acquaintance insisted to me that \"women did not have orgasms in the old west.\").\"\n\n\n=== 1990s and 2000s ===\nReadership of western fiction reached a new low in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and most bookstores, outside a few western states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. Nevertheless, several Western fiction series are published monthly, such as The Trailsman, Slocum, Longarm and The Gunsmith; these are all \"adult westerns\". The genre has seen the rumblings of a revival, and 2008 saw the publication of an all-Western short story magazine Great Western Fiction which was published by Dry River Publishing in Colorado. Nevertheless, the magazine was short-lived and folded after only two issues.\n\n\n== Organizations ==\nWestern authors are represented by the Western Writers of America, who present the annual Spur Awards and Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. The organization was founded in 1953 to promote the literature of the American West. While the founding members were mostly western fiction writers, the organization began getting a number of other members from other backgrounds such as historians, regional history buffs, and writers from other genres.\nWestern Fictioneers, founded in 2010, is a professional writers' group that encourages and promotes the traditional Westerns. It is the only professional writers' organization composed entirely of authors who have written Western fiction. Fans of the genre may join as patron members. The Western Fictioneers' annual Peacemakers competition awards prizes in many categories of Western writing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Western fiction authors\nWestern (genre)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBoatright, Mody C. \"The Formula in Cowboy Fiction and Drama.\" Western Folklore (1969): 136\u2013145. in JSTOR\nDavis, David B. \"Ten-Gallon Hero.\" American Quarterly (1954) 6#2 pp: 111\u2013125. in JSTOR\nDurham, Philip. \"The Cowboy and the Myth Makers.\" The Journal of Popular Culture (1967) 1#1 pp: 58\u201362.\nEstleman, Loren D.

        "wikipedia_content": "War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.\nNations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.\nSubgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, animated, propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or Vietnam; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines, or at prisoner of war camps.\n\n\n== Genre ==\n\nThe war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film Institute, for example, speaks of \"films to grapple with the Great War\" without attempting to classify these. However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that \"a war film\u2019s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war.\" John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.\n\nThe film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War. The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, \"successful and influential\" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing. The film scholar Kathryn Kane points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World War II as a conflict between \"good\" and \"evil\" as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples. James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and \"war-movie escapades\" like The Dirty Dozen.Film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that\nWhat I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture would know about World War II combat films\u2014that they contained a hero, a group of mixed types [of people], and a military objective of some sort. They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain many repeated events, such as mail call, all presented visually with appropriate uniforms, equipment, and iconography of battle.\nFurther, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of \"the World War II combat film\", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of \"hastily assembled volunteers\" hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their \"bravery and tenacity\". She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that lie on the margins of being war films. However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal \"with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)\" Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which \"determines the fate of the principal characters\". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films. Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about that war which he considers \"notable\".The military historian Antony Beevor \"despair[s]\" at how film-makers from America and Britain \"play fast and loose with the facts\", yet imply that \"their version is as good as the truth.\" For example, he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a \"shameless deception\" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the Atlantic\u2014seven months before America entered the war. He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by the \"little ships\". Beevor feels, however, that European film-makers are often \"far more scrupulous\"; for example, in his view the 2004 German film Downfall accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker, and he considers the 1965 French film The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, \"the greatest war movie ever made.\" The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close second.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The American Civil War ===\nThe costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivi\u00e8re du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.\n\n\n=== The Spanish\u2013American War ===\nThe first war films come from the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898. Short \"actualities\" \u2013 documentary film-clips \u2013 included Burial of the Maine Victims, Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit, and Soldiers Washing Dishes. These non-combat films were accompanied by \"reenactments\" of fighting, such as of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Rough Riders\" in action against the Spanish, staged in the United States.\n\n\n=== The First World War ===\n\nDuring the First World War, many films were made about life in the war. Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemy\u015bl, disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras. The 1915 Australian film Within Our Gates (also known as Deeds that Won Gallipoli) by Frank Harvey was described by the Motion Picture News as \"a really good war story, which is exceptional\".\n\nThe 1916 British film The Battle of the Somme, by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making it what the critic Francine Stock called \"one of the most successful films of all time\". The 1925 American film The Big Parade depicted unglamorous elements of war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed. William A. Wellman's Wings (1927) was the first film (in any genre), and the only silent film, to win an Oscar for best picture. Later films of varied genres that deal with the First World War include David Lean's \"colossal epic\", both war film and biopic Lawrence of Arabia (1962), shot in the then unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor, and described by Steven Spielberg as \"maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the motion-picture medium\"; Richard Attenborough's satirical anti-war musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood's play of the same name, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969); and Spielberg's war drama War Horse (2011) based on Michael Morpurgo's children's novel of the same name.\n\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War ===\n\nThe Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries. Sam Wood's For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168 minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a \"beautiful\" orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics. Alain Resnais's Guernica (1950) uses Picasso's  painting to protest against war. Carlos Saura's La Caza (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966. Ken Loach's Land and Freedom (Tierra y Libertad, 1995), loosely based on George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.\n\n\n=== The Korean War ===\n\nSamuel Fuller\u2019s The Steel Helmet (1951) was made during the Korean War (1950\u20131953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) and Pork Chop Hill (1959). Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers of \"the only war we have lost\".In 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film Piagol  about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. Censorship loosened in the 1980s. The Taebaek Mountains (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for the communists, while Silver Stallion (1991) and Spring in My Hometown (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films Shiri (1999) and Joint Security Area (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.Films in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear political messages. The first was My Home Village (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Sch\u00f6nherr concludes that the purpose of these films is \"to portray North Korea as a country under siege\", and that since the U.S. and its \"puppet\" South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.\n\n\n=== The Algerian War ===\nGillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La battaglia di Algeri; Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e; French: La Bataille d'Alger), 1966) portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954\u20131956). It was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It was attacked by French critics and was for five years banned in France.\n\n\n=== The Vietnam War ===\n\nFew films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).  With the shift in American politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films such as Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986), Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987) and John Irvin's Hamburger Hill (1987).The Vietnamese director Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ed3ng S\u1ebfn's The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone (C\u00e1nh \u0111\u1ed3ng hoang, 1979) gives an \"unnerving and compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view\" of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American) \"helicopter-eye view\", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness seen earlier.\n\n\n=== The Bosnian War ===\nDino Mustafi\u0107's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107, tells the parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. According to Top\u010di\u0107, the story is based on incidents from his own life.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\n\n\n=== Films made by the Western Allies ===\n\nThe first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda. Films such as The Lion Has Wings and Target for Tonight were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like No\u00ebl Coward and David Lean's In Which We Serve (1942) \u2013 \"the most successful British film of the war years\", Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).\n\nIn America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British family on the home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).\n\nThe Russians, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary Moscow Strikes Back (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0439, literally \"The rout of the German troops near Moscow\"), was made during the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red Square and Stalin's speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best documentary. Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record \"the spectacle which greeted the Russian soldiers\" \u2013 the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of Stalingrad.Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship and were not always realistic. One of the first to attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for \"gritty realism\", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the \"worst image for stark violence\" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.\n\n\n=== Films made by the Axis powers ===\n\nThe Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command brought out Sieg im Westen (\"Victory in the West\", 1941). Other Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with Kolberg (1945), which depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg (1807) to the invading French troops under Napoleon. The propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the siege.For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called \"The China Incident\". The government dispatched a \"pen brigade\" to write and film the action in China with \"humanist values\". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura's Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as \"losers do not get reruns\", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the \"cultural enemy\". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and \"what mattered was not whom one fought but how well\". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an \"innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people\". Dower comments that the perversity of this image \"is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others.\"\n\n\n=== Films made after the war ===\n\nAccording to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with war films became an \"obsession\", with over 200 war films produced in each decade of the 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s.  Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of  Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an \"exclusively British [victory]\", it failed to break into the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955-58 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That Got Away and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end of the decade the \" sense of shared achievement\" which had been common in war films \"began to evaporate\", according to Pulver.Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) starring John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered Sands of Iwo Jima visually authentic, but found Lewis Milestone's Battle Cry (1955), with its attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film. The formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died. Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group should contain \"an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, \"Iowa\" or \"Dakota\"), and a character who must be initiated in some way\". Films based on real commando missions, like The Gift Horse (1952) based on the St. Nazaire Raid, and Ill Met by Moonlight (1956) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964) and Where Eagles Dare (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama The Longest Day (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving commercial success and Oscars. It was followed by large-scale but thoughtful films like Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood (1962),  and quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as Battle of the Bulge (1965), Battle of Britain (1969), The Battle of Neretva (1969), Midway (1976) and A Bridge Too Far (1977). In Lawrence Suid's view, The Longest Day \"served as the model for all subsequent combat spectaculars\". However, its cost also made it the last of the traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the U.S. Army and Zanuck's \"disregard for Pentagon relations\" changed the way that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.Zanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an American-Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer's Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) to depict what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\" in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The film, panned by Roger Ebert and The New York Times, was a major success in Japan. Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later films such as Midway (1976), The Final Countdown (1980), and Australia (2008). \nThe story was revisited in Pearl Harbor (2001), described by The New York Times as a \"noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster\", with the comment that \"for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture\".Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound design, staging and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film historian Stuart Bender calls \"reported realism\", whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic. Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as \"groundbreaking and anti-generic\", with, in James Wolcott's words, a \"desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time\"; and that combat films have always been \"grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war\". Its success revived interest in World War II films. Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in  Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said \"goes about as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter.\"\n\n\n=== Military\u2013film industry relations ===\n\nMany war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The U.S. Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics have argued that the film Pearl Harbor's US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films \"have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions\".\n\n\n== National traditions ==\n\n\n=== Chinese ===\nThe first Chinese war films were newsreels like Battle of Wuhan (1911) and Battle of Shanghai (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's Battle Exploits (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's Protect Our Land (1938) The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin's From Victory to Victory (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same period is Xie Jin's The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale commercial films include Lu Chuan's City of Life and Death (2009). Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the Nanking massacre (1937\u20131938), with films such as the political melodrama Massacre in Nanjing, Mou Tun Fei's docudrama Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, and the \"contrived Sino\u2013Japanese romance\" Don't Cry, Nanking. Zhang Yimou's epic Chinese film Flowers of War (2011), based on Geling Yan's novel, portrays the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\n=== Indonesian ===\n\nMany Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya's Doea Tanda Mata (Mementos, literally \"Two Eye Marks\", 1985) covers the limited nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.  A third group of films such as Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta, 1951) and Serangan Fajar (Attack at Dawn, 1983) covers the Indonesian war of independence (1945\u20131949). Two other films about the same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long March: Usmar Ismail's Darah dan Doa (The Long March, literally \"Blood and Prayer\", 1950) and Mereka Kembali (They Return, 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own time.The more recent Merdeka (Freedom) trilogy (2009\u20132011), starting with Merah Putih (\"Red and White\", the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.Karya's November 1828 (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War (1825\u20131830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne Schultz considered it \"a valuable interpretation\" of Indonesian history that \"embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema.\" It was the first Indonesian film to become well-known internationally.\n\n\n=== Russian ===\n\nWar has been Russian cinema's major genre, becoming known indeed as the \"cinema front\", and its war films ranged from grim portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive accounts. Leonid Lukov's popular and \"beautiful\" Two Warriors (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet Russian and an extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.The many Russian films about the Second World War include both large-scale epics such as Yury Ozerov's Battle of Moscow (1985) and Mikhail Kalatozov's more psychological  The Cranes are Flying (1957) on the cruel effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.\n\n\n=== Japanese ===\n\nJapanese directors have made popular films such as Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender (1959), Battle of Okinawa (1971) and Japan's Longest Day (1967) from a Japanese perspective. These \"generally fail to explain the cause of the war\". In the decades immediately after the Second World War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy rather than combat, such as The Burmese Harp (1956), Fires on the Plain, (1959). From the late 1990s, films started to take a positive view of the war and of Japanese actions. These nationalistic films, including Pride (1998), Merdeka 17805 (2001), and The Truth about Nanjing (2007), have emphasized positive traits of the Japanese military and contended that the Japanese were victims of post-war vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have, however, drawn protest for revisionism. The Eternal Zero (2013) narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is considered a coward by his comrades, as he returns alive from his missions. It broke the record takings for a Japanese live action film, and won the Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film Festival, but was criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with kamikaze pilots.\n\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n\n=== Documentary ===\n\nThe wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.\n\n\n=== Propaganda ===\n\nSergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama Alexander Nevsky depicts Prince Alexander's defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city of Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights. By April 1939 the film had been seen by 23,000,000 people. In 1941 the director and three others were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film features a musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev, considered by artists such as the composer Andr\u00e9 Previn the best ever written for cinema. Russell Merritt, writing in Film Quarterly, describes it as a \"war propaganda film\". A 1978 Mondadori poll placed Alexander Nevsky among the world's 100 best motion pictures.\n\nDuring the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth Clark advised the British government that \"If we renounced interest in entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for getting across our propaganda\"; he suggested using documentaries about the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a story about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting film, 49th Parallel (1941), became the top film at British offices that year. Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for vigilance, too, as in Went the Day Well? (1942) or the avoidance of \"careless talk\", as in The Next of Kin (1942).\n\nIn America, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) clearly satirised fascism. Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1943) was not simply a romance between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, but vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to them. Frank Capra's Why We Fight series (1942\u20131945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best documentary, though it was designed to \"influence opinion in the U.S. military\".During the Cold War, \"propaganda played as much of a role in the United States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars spent on weaponry.\" Face to Face with Communism (1951) dramatised an imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such as communist indoctrination.\n\n\n=== Submarine ===\n\nSubmarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.\n\n\n=== Prisoner of war ===\n\nA popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner of war film. The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's The Great Escape (1963). They told stories of real escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as fun. David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance. The \"definitive\" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of The Deer Hunter (1977) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.\n\n\n=== Comedy ===\n\nCharlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918) set a style for war films to come, and was the first comedy about war in film history.\nBritish cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children from London with social comedies such as Those Kids from Town (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an earl (a country nobleman), while in Cottage to Let (1941) and Went the Day Well? (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies. Gasbags (1941) offered \"zany, irreverent, knockabout\" comedy making fun of everything from barrage balloons to concentration camps. Abbott and Costello's Buck Privates (1941) was successful in America, leading to many further wartime comedies.\n\n\n=== Animated ===\n\nWinsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was a silent First World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has survived. Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945, including Der Fuehrer's Face (1943) and Education for Death (1943).Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of war. Akira (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; Grave of the Fireflies (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children. Barefoot Gen (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a child, but reviewers consider it a less well made film than Grave of the Fireflies with \"stomach-churning detail\" bizarrely paired with crude artwork, giving it the look of a \"Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoon\".\n\n\n=== Anti-war ===\n\nThe anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two Oscars, best picture and best director. Andrew Kelly, analysing All Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities. While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board. The number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist. The end of the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics: Jean Renoir's  prisoner of war masterpiece La Grande Illusion (The Grand Illusion, 1937), and Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein notes that Paths of Glory established Kubrick as the \"leading commercial filmmaker of his generation\" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an \"outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake\", contrasting it with the \"classic\" All Quiet on the Western Front's story of an innocent \"unstrung by the horrors of war\".\n\n\n=== Mixed genres ===\nComedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr Strangelove (1964). Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22 (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam War.Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time; and Patton won seven Academy Awards.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBasinger, Jeanine (1986).

        "wikipedia_content": "A textbook is a comprehensive compilation of content in a branch of study. Textbooks are produced to meet the needs of educators, usually at educational institutions. Schoolbooks are textbooks and other books used in schools. Today, many textbooks are published in both print format and digital formats.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of textbooks dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, Ancient Greeks wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. Johannes Gutenberg himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.\nThe Greek philosopher Plato lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing. Before the invention of the Greek alphabet 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like Homer's epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student Plato in his famous Dialogues.) The next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw printing press to transfer the image onto paper.\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic Gutenberg Bible in the 1450s \u2014 a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.While many textbooks were already in use, compulsory education and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century New England Primer and the 19th century McGuffey Readers.\nRecent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (\"e-books\"), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is Principles of Biology from Nature Publishing.\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a creative commons or other open license.\n\n\n== Market ==\n\n\n=== The market for textbooks ===\nAs in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the USA). Also, elasticity of demand is fairly low. The term \"broken market\" appeared in the economist James Koch's analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.\n\n\n=== New editions and the used book market in the USA ===\nSome students save money by buying used copies of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive, and are available from many college bookstores in the USA, who buy them back from students at the end of a term. Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.  Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.\"  A study conducted by The Student PIRGs found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by demand from teachers. That study found that 76% of teachers said new editions were justified \u201chalf of the time or less\u201d and 40% said they were justified \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d. The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on e-textbooks does not always save students money. Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.\n\n\n=== Bundling in the USA ===\nAnother publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is \"bundling\", or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook.  Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material. Students often cannot buy these things separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.According to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d use the bundled items in their courses.A 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report in the USA found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:\n\nWhile publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers\u2019 practice \nof packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.\n\nBundling has also been used to segment the used book market. Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\nLegislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\"  The Federal bill only exempts 3rd party materials in integrated textbooks, however publisher lobbyists have attempted to create a loophole through this definition in state bills.\n\n\n=== Price disclosure ===\nGiven that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the \"broken\" economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures.  By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.\nNo data suggests that this is in fact true.  However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain.  Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked.  Furthermore, the study found that 23% of faculty rated publisher websites as \u201cinformative and easy to use\u201d and less than half said they typically listed the price.The US Congress passed a law in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act that would require price disclosure.  Legislation requiring price disclosure has passed in Connecticut, Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Publishers are currently supporting price disclosure mandates, though they insist that the \"suggested retail price\" should be disclosed, rather than the actual price the publisher would get for the book.\n\n\n=== Used textbook market ===\nOnce a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\n\n==== Campus buyback ====\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.When students resell their textbooks during campus \u201cbuyback\u201d periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\n\n==== Student to student sales ====\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the US Air Force Academy, it is possible to e-mail entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\n\n==== Student online marketplaces ====\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an online auction format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\n\n==== Online book buyers ====\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the ISBN numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\n\n==== Textbook exchanges ====\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\nAccording to textbook author Henry L. Roediger (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books. The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction.  The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of used books, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\n\n==== E-textbooks ====\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks.The article \"E books rewrite the rules of education\" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\". According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".\n\n\n=== Rental programs ===\nIn-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.\n\n\n=== Textbook sharing ===\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\n\n=== Open textbooks ===\n\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An open textbook is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders.  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard. A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.Although the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense. To offer another perspective, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work. Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher Flat World Knowledge already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.  Their business model was to offer the open textbook free online, and then sell ancillary products that students are likely to buy if prices are reasonable - print copies, study guides, ePub, .Mobi (Kindle), PDF download, etc. Flat World Knowledge compensates its authors with royalties on these sales. With the generated revenue Flat World Knowledge funded high-quality publishing activities with a goal of making the Flat World financial model sustainable. However, in January, 2013 Flat World Knowledge announced their financial model could no longer sustain their free-to-read options for students.  Flat World Knowledge intends to have open textbooks available for the 125 highest-enrolled courses on college campuses within the next few years.CK-12 FlexBooks are the open textbooks designed for United States K-12 courses. CK-12 FlexBooks are designed to facilitate conformance to national and United States and individual state textbook standards. CK-12 FlexBooks are licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. CK-12 FlexBooks are free to use online and offer formats suitable for use on portable personal reading devices and computers - both online and offline. Formats for both iPad and Kindle are offered. School districts may select a title as is or customize the open textbook to meet local instructional standards. The file may be then accessed electronically or printed using any print on demand service without paying a royalty, saving 80% or more when compared to traditional textbook options. An example print on demand open textbook title, \"College Algebra\" by Stitz & Zeager through Lulu is 608 pages, royalty free, and costs about $20 ordered one at a time (March, 2011). (Any print on demand service could be used - this is just an example. School districts could easily negotiate even lower prices for bulk purchases to be printed in their own communities.) Teacher's editions are available for educators and parents. Titles have been authored by various individuals and organizations and are vetted for quality prior to inclusion in the CK-12 catalog. An effort is underway to map state educational standards correlations. Stanford University provided a number of titles in use.Curriki is another modular K-12 content non-profit \"empowering educators to deliver and share curricula.\" Selected Curriki materials are also correlated to U.S. state educational standards. Some Curriki content has been collected into open textbooks and some may be used for modular lessons or special topics.\n\n\n=== International market pricing ===\nSimilar to the issue of reimportation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S. market, the GAO report also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 Supreme Court decision Quality King v. L'anza protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine, textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors. Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.  For example, some U.S. booksellers arrange for drop-shipments in foreign countries which are then re-shipped to America where the books can be sold online at used prices (for a \"new\" unopened book). The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\n\n=== Production ===\n\n\n==== Cost distribution ====\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada.\nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.\n\n\n==== Research ====\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\n\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\nRising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.\n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005: \"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.\"\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board\u2019s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007: \"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.\"\n\n\n== K-12 textbooks ==\nIn most U.S. K-12 public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the Texas Education Agency sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\n\n=== High school ===\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as Howard Zinn (A People's History of the United States), Gilbert T. Sewall (Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child) and James W. Loewen (Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong), make the claim that U.S. history textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient Rome to the Soviet Union (USSR) and the People's Republic of China. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.Science textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on creation and evolution in the public education debate. The Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\nIn his book, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, the late physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard P. Feynman described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks. At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent \u2014 for reasons of timing \u2014 a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of new math and reform mathematics which have sought to replace traditional mathematics in what have been called the math wars. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity with approaches that often incorporate principles of constructivism and discovery. Texts such as TERC and CMP discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices  increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, \u201cTurn the Page,\u201d reported that the average U.S. student spends $700\u2013$1000 per year on textbooks.While many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party\u2014faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers\u2014for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward open textbooks and other lower-cost digital solutions.\nTextbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.\n\n\n== Textbook bias on controversial topics ==\nIn cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, \"the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn Amos Comenius - \"the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization\"\nOrbis Pictus - 1658 textbook by Comenius, one of the first books with pictures for children\nCasebook - A special type of textbook used in law schools in the United States.\nKirtsaeng v.

        "label": "yakuza film",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_film",
        "wikipedia_content": "Yakuza film (Japanese: \u30e4\u30af\u30b6\u6620\u753b, Hepburn: Yakuza Eiga) is a popular film genre in Japanese cinema which focuses on the lives and dealings of yakuza, Japanese organized crime syndicates.\n\n\n== Early films ==\nIn the silent film era, films depicting bakuto (precursors to modern yakuza) as Robin Hood-like characters were common. They often portrayed historical figures who had accumulated legends over time as \"sympathetic but lonely figures, forced to live an outlaw existence and longing, however hopelessly, to return to straight society.\" Kunisada Ch\u016bji was a popular subject, such as in Daisuke It\u014d's three-part A Diary of Chuji's Travels from 1927. During World War II, the Japanese government used cinema as wartime propaganda, and as such depictions of bakuto generally faded. Mark Schilling named Akira Kurosawa's Drunken Angel from 1948 as the first to depict post-war yakuza in his book The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films, although he noted it does not follow the genre's common themes. The Occupation of Japan that followed World War II also monitored the films being made. However, when the occupation ended in 1952, period-pieces of all types returned to popularity. A notable modern yakuza example is 1961's Hana to Arashi to Gang by Teruo Ishii which launched a series that depicted contemporary gang life including gang warfare.\n\n\n== \"Borderless Action\" and Ninkyo eiga ==\nThe studio Nikkatsu made modern yakuza films under the Mukokuseki Action (\u7121\u56fd\u7c4d\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3, Mukokuseki Akushon) or \"Borderless Action\" moniker, which, unlike other studios in the genre, borrowed heavily from Hollywood gangster films. These are typified by the Wataridori series that started in 1959 and star Akira Kobayashi and, in most installments, Joe Shishido.A subset of films known as Ninkyo eiga (\u4ec1\u4fa0\u6620\u753b) or \"chivalry films\" then began to thrive. Most were created by the Toei studio and produced by Koji Shundo, who became close with actual yakuza before becoming a producer, and despite his denial, is said to have been one himself. Set in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras, the kimono-clad yakuza hero of ninkyo films (personified by K\u014dji Tsuruta and Ken Takakura) was always portrayed as a stoic honorable outlaw torn between the contradictory values of giri (duty) and ninjo (personal feelings). Sadao Yamane stated their willingness to fight and die to save someone or their boss was portrayed as \"something beautiful.\" In his book, Schilling cited Tadashi Sawashima's Jinsei Gekijo: Hishakaku from 1963 as starting the Ninkyo eiga trend. Ninkyo eiga were popular with young males that had traveled to cities from the countryside in search of jobs and education, only to find themselves in harsh work conditions for low pay. In their book Yakuza Film and Their Times, Tsukasa Shiba and Sakae Aoyama write that these young men \"isolated in an era of high economic growth and tight social structures\" were attracted to the \"motifs of male comrades banding together to battle the power structure.\"Shundo supervised Takakura and helped Toei sign Tsuruta, additionally his own daughter Junko Fuji became a popular female yakuza actress starring in the Hibotan Bakuto series. Nikkatsu made their first ninkyo eiga, Otoko no Monsho starring Hideki Takahashi, in 1963 to combat Toei's success in the genre. However, today Nikkatsu is best known for the surreal B movies by Seijun Suzuki, which culminated with the director being fired after 1967's Branded to Kill. Likewise, Daiei Film entered the field with Akumy\u014d in 1961 starring Shintaro Katsu. They also had Toei's rival in the female yakuza genre with Ky\u014dko Enami starring in the Onna Tobakuchi series.In 1965, Teruo Ishii directed the first installment in the Abashiri Prison series, which was a huge success and launched Takakura to stardom.\n\n\n== 1970s and Jitsuroku eiga ==\nMany Japanese movie critics cite the retirement of Junko Fuji in 1972 as marking the decline of the Ninkyo eiga. Just as moviegoers were getting tired of the ninkyo films, a new breed of yakuza films emerged, the Jitsuroku eiga (\u5b9f\u9332\u6620\u753b, \"actual record films\"). These films portrayed post-war yakuza not as honorable heirs to the samurai code, but as ruthless, treacherous street thugs living for their own desires. Many jitsuroku eiga were based on true stories, and filmed in a documentary style with shaky camera. The Jitsuroku genre was popularized by Kinji Fukasaku's groundbreaking 1973 yakuza epic Battles Without Honor and Humanity. Based on the events of real-life yakuza, the film starring Bunta Sugawara spawned four sequels and another three part series.\nFukusaku biographer Sadao Yamane believes the films were popular because of the time of their release; Japan's economic growth was at its peak and at the end of the 1960s the student uprisings took place. The young people had similar feelings to those of the post-war society depicted in the film. Schilling wrote that after the success of Battles Without Honor and Humanity, Takakura and Tsuruta received less and less roles at the direction of Toei's president. Soon after, Shundo retired, although he would later return.\n\n\n== Decline and home video resurgence ==\n\nIn the 1980s, yakuza movies drastically declined due in part to the rise of home video VCRs. One exception was the Gokud\u014d no Onnatachi series starring Shima Iwashita, which was based on a book of interviews with the wives and girlfriends of real gangsters. In 1994, Toei actually announced that The Man Who Shot the Don starring Hiroki Matsukata would be their last yakuza film unless it made $4 million US in home video rentals. It did not and they announced they would stop producing such movies, although they returned a couple of years later.But in the 1990s, the low-budget direct-to-video movies called Gokud\u014d brought a wealth of yakuza movies, such as Toei's V-Cinema line in 1990. Many young directors had freedom to push the genre's envelope. One such director was Rokur\u014d Mochizuki who broke through with Onibi in 1997. Directors such as Shinji Aoyama and Kiyoshi Kurosawa started out in the home video market before becoming regulars on the international festival circuit. Though the most well-known gokud\u014d creator is Takashi Miike, who has become known internationally for his extremely violent, genre pushing and border crossing (yakuza movies taking place outside Japan, such as his 1997 Rainy Dog) films in the style.One director who did not partake in the home video circuit is Takeshi Kitano, whose existential yakuza films are known around the world for a unique style. His films use harsh edits, minimalist dialogue, odd humor, and extreme violence that began with Sonatine (1993) and was perfected in  Hana-bi (1997).\n\n\n== Prominent actors ==\n\n\n== Selected films ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources =="

        "label": "Waka (Poetry)",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_(poetry)",
        "wikipedia_content": "Waka (\u548c\u6b4c, \"Japanese poem\") is a type of poetry in classical Japanese literature. Waka are composed in Japanese, and are contrasted with poetry composed by Japanese poets in Classical Chinese, which are known as kanshi. Although waka in modern Japanese is written as \u548c\u6b4c, in the past it was also written as \u502d\u6b4c (see Wa (Japan)), and a variant name is yamato-uta (\u5927\u548c\u6b4c).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word waka has two different but related meanings: the original meaning was \"poetry in Japanese\" and encompassed several genres such as ch\u014dka and sed\u014dka (discussed below); the later, more common definition refers to poetry in a 5-7-5-7-7 metre. Up to and during the compilation of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b in the eighth century, the word waka was a general term for poetry composed in Japanese, and included several genres such as tanka (\u77ed\u6b4c, \"short poem\"), ch\u014dka (\u9577\u6b4c, \"long poem\"), bussokusekika (\u4ecf\u8db3\u77f3\u6b4c, \"Buddha footprint poem\") and sed\u014dka (\u65cb\u982d\u6b4c, \"repeating-the-first-part poem\"). However, by the time of the Kokinsh\u016b's compilation at the beginning of the tenth century, all of these forms except for the tanka and ch\u014dka had effectively gone extinct, and ch\u014dka had significantly diminished in prominence. As a result, the word waka became effectively synonymous with tanka, and the word tanka fell out of use until it was revived at the end of the nineteenth century (see Tanka).\nTanka (hereafter referred to as waka) consist of five lines (\u53e5, ku, literally \"phrases\") of 5-7-5-7-7 on or syllabic units.\u3000Therefore, tanka is sometimes called Misohitomoji (\u4e09\u5341\u4e00\u6587\u5b57), meaning it contains 31 syllables in total.\n\n\n== Forms of waka ==\nThe term waka originally encompassed a number of differing forms, principally tanka (\u77ed\u6b4c, \"short poem\") and ch\u014dka (\u9577\u6b4c, \"long poem\"), but also including bussokusekika, sed\u014dka (\u65cb\u982d\u6b4c, \"memorized poem\") and katauta (\u7247\u6b4c, \"poem fragment\"). These last three forms, however, fell into disuse at the beginning of the Heian period, and ch\u014dka vanished soon afterwards. Thus, the term waka came in time to refer only to tanka.\n\n\n=== Ch\u014dka ===\nCh\u014dka consist of 5-7 on phrases repeated at least twice, and conclude with a 5-7-7 ending\nThe briefest ch\u014dka documented is Man'y\u014dsh\u016b no. 802, which is of a pattern 5-7 5-7 5-7 5-7-7. It was composed by Yamanoue no Okura in the Nara period and runs:\n\nThe ch\u014dka above is followed by an envoi (\u53cd\u6b4c, hanka) in tanka form, also written by Okura:\n\n[English translation by Edwin Cranston]\nIn the early Heian period (at the beginning of the 10th century), ch\u014dka was seldom written and tanka became the main form of waka. Since then, the generic term waka came to be almost synonymous with tanka. Famous examples of such works are the diaries of Ki no Tsurayuki and Izumi Shikibu, as well as such collections of poem tales as The Tales of Ise and The Tales of Yamato.\n\n\n=== Minor forms of waka ===\nLesser forms of waka featured in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and other ancient sources exist. Besides that, there were many other forms like:\n\nBussokusekika: This form carved on a slab of slate \u2013 the \"Buddha footprint\" or bussokuseki \u2013 at the Yakushi-ji temple in Nara. Also recorded in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. The pattern is 5-7-5-7-7-7.\nSed\u014dka: The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and Kokinsh\u016b recorded this form. The pattern is 5-7-7-5-7-7.\nKatauta: The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b recorded this form. Katauta means \"half-poem\". The pattern is 5-7-7.\n\n\n== History ==\nWaka has a long history, first recorded in the early 8th century in the Kojiki and Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. Under influence from other genres such as kanshi, novels and stories such as Tale of Genji and even Western poetry, it developed gradually, broadening its repertoire of expression and topics.\nIn literary historian Donald Keene's books, he uses four large categories:\n\nEarly and Heian Literature (Kojiki to past The Tale of Genji to 1185)\nThe Middle Ages ('ch\u016bsei' from 1185, including the Kamakura and Muromachi periods)\nPre-Modern Era (1600\u20131867, then subdivided into 1600\u20131770 and 1770\u20131867)\nModern Era (post 1867, divided into Meiji (1868\u20131912), Taish\u014d (1912\u20131926) and Sh\u014dwa (from 1927)).\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nThe most ancient waka were recorded in the historical record the Kojiki and the 20 volumes of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest surviving waka anthology. The editor of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b is anonymous, but it is believed that the final editor was \u014ctomo no Yakamochi. He was a waka poet who belonged to the youngest generation represented in the anthology; indeed, the last volume is dominated by his poems. The first waka of volume 1 was by Emperor \u014cjin. Nukata no \u014ckimi, Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, Yamabe no Akahito, Yamanoue no Okura, \u014ctomo no Tabito and his son Yakamochi were the greatest poets in this anthology. The Man'y\u014dsh\u016b recorded not only the works of the royalty and nobility, but also works of soldiers and farmers whose names were not recorded. The main topics of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b were love, sadness (especially on the occasion of someone's death), and other miscellaneous topics.\n\nEarly songsSongs and poetry in the Kojiki and the Nihon ShokiThe Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\n\n\n=== Classical ===\n\n\n=== Heian revival ===\nDuring the Nara period and the early Heian period, the court favored Chinese-style poetry (kanshi) and the waka art form largely fell out of official favor. But in the 9th century, Japan stopped sending official envoys to Tang dynasty China. This severing of ties, combined with Japan's geographic isolation, essentially forced the court to cultivate native talent and look inward, synthesizing Chinese poetic styles and techniques with local traditions. The waka form again began flourishing and Emperor Daigo ordered the creation of an anthology of waka. where the waka of ancient poets and their contemporaries were collected and the anthology named \"Kokin Wakash\u016b\", meaning Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poems. It was presented to the emperor in 905. This was the first waka anthology edited and issued under imperial auspices, and it commenced a long and distinguished tradition of imperial anthologies of waka that continued up to the Muromachi period.\n\nRise of Japanese national cultureThe first three chokusensh\u016bThe first three imperially-commissioned waka anthologies (\u4e09\u4ee3\u96c6, Sandai-sh\u016b) were the Kokin Wakash\u016b, the Gosen Wakash\u016b and the Sh\u016bi Wakash\u016b. The Kokinsh\u016b was compiled by Ki no Tsurayuki, Ki no Tomonori, \u014cshik\u014dchi no Mitsune and Mibu no Tadamine on the orders of Emperor Daigo in 905. It collected roughly 1,100 waka that had not appeared in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b into 20 volumes, arranged by theme. The Kokinsh\u016b poems are generally considered to be reflective and idealistic.Roughly half a century after the compilation of the Kokinsh\u016b, in 951, Emperor Murakami commanded the Five Men of the Pear Chamber to compile the Gosen Wakash\u016b, in addition to preparing kundoku readings for the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, which by that time was already difficult for even educated Japanese to read.\nIn 1005 Emperor Ichij\u014d commanded the compilation of the Sh\u016bish\u016b.\n\nThe five later-Heian anthologiesThe above three court anthologies, in addition to the five following anthologies, are known as the \"Collections of Eight Ages\" (\u516b\u4ee3\u96c6, Hachidai-sh\u016b), and were all compiled during the Heian period.\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\n\n\n=== Kamakura and Muromachi periods ===\nAfter the Heian period, during the Kamakura period and later, renga, a form of collaborative linked poetry, began to develop. In the late Heian period, three of the last great waka poets appeared: Fujiwara no Shunzei, his son Fujiwara no Teika, and Emperor Go-Toba. Emperor Go-Toba ordered the creation of a new anthology and joined in editing it. The anthology was named Shin Kokin Wakash\u016b. He edited it again and again until he died in 1239. Teika made copies of ancient books and wrote on the theory of waka. His descendants, and indeed almost all subsequent poets, such as Sh\u014dtetsu, taught his methods and studied his poems. The courtly poetry scenes were historically dominated by a few noble clans and allies, each of which staked out a position.\nBy this period, a number of clans had fallen by the wayside, leaving the Reizei and the Nij\u014d families; the former stood for \"progressive\" approaches, the varied use of the \"ten styles\" and novelty, while the latter conservatively hewed to already established norms and the \"ushin\" (deep feelings) style that dominated courtly poetry. Eventually, the Nijo family became defunct, leading to the ascendancy of the \"liberal\" Reizei family.  Their innovative reign was soon deposed by the Asukai family, aided by the Ashikaga sh\u014dgun, Ashikaga Yoshinori.\nIn the Muromachi period, renga became popular in the court and people around it. It spread to the priestly classes and thence to wealthy commoners. In much the same way as waka, renga anthologies were produced under the imperial aegis.  As momentum and popular interest shifted to the renga form, the tanka style was left to the Imperial court. Conservative tendencies exacerbated the loss of life and flexibility. A tradition named Kokin-denju, the heritage of Kokin Wakash\u016b, was developed. It was a system on how to analyze the Kokin Wakash\u016b and included the secret (or precisely lost) meaning of words. Studying waka degenerated into learning the many intricate rules, allusions,  theories, and secrets, so as to produce tanka that would be accepted by the court.\nThere were comical waka already in the Kojiki and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, but the noble style of waka in the court inhibited and scorned such aspects of waka. Renga was soon in the same position with many codes and strictures reflecting literary tradition. Haikai no renga (also called just haikai (playful renga)) and ky\u014dka, comical waka, were a reaction to this seriousness. But in the Edo-period waka itself lost almost all of its flexibility and began to echo and repeat old poems and themes.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\n\n=== Edo period (1603\u20131867) ===\nIn the early Edo period, waka was not a fashionable genre. Newly created haikai no renga (of whose hokku, or opening verse, haiku was a late 19th-century revision) was the favored genre. This tendency was kept during this period, but in the late Edo period waka faced new trends from beyond the court. Motoori Norinaga, the great reviver of the traditional Japanese literature, attempted to revive waka as a way of providing \"traditional feeling expressed in genuine Japanese way\". He wrote waka, and waka became an important form to his followers, the Kokugaku scholars.\nIn Echigo Province a Buddhist priest, Ry\u014dkan, composed many waka in a na\u00efve style intentionally avoiding complex rules and the traditional way of waka. He belonged to another great tradition of waka: waka for expressing religious feeling. His frank expression of his feeling found many admirers, then and now. In the cities, a comical, ironic and satiric form of waka emerged. It was called ky\u014dka (\u72c2\u6b4c), mad poem, and was loved by intellectual people in big cities like Edo and Osaka. It was not precisely a new form; satirical waka was a style known since ancient times. But it was in the Edo period that this aspect of waka developed and reached an artistic peak. Still, most waka poets kept to ancient tradition or made those reformation another stereotype, and waka was not a vibrant genre in general at the end of this period.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\n\n\n== Notable waka poets ==\nKakinomoto no Hitomaro\nYamabe no Akahito\n\u014ctomo no Yakamochi\nHenj\u014d\nAriwara no Narihira\nFun'ya no Yasuhide\nKisen\nOno no Komachi\n\u014ctomo no Kuronushi\nIzumi Shikibu\nK\u016bkai\nKi no Tsurayuki\nMurasaki Shikibu\nFujiwara no Teika (1162\u20131241)\nSaigy\u014d (1118\u20131190)\nMinamoto no Sanetomo (1192-1219)\nEmperor Go-Toba (1180\u20131239)\nKamo no Ch\u014dmei (1155\u20131216)\nMotoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801)\nUeda Akinari (1734\u20131809)\nRy\u014dkan (1758\u20131831)\nPrincess Kazu (1846\u20131877)\nEmperor Meiji (1852-1912)\n\n\n== Famous waka collections ==\nNij\u016bichidaish\u016b \u2013 The collective name for all 21 Imperially-commissioned waka anthologies\nHyakunin Isshu \u2013 Fujiwara no Teika's collection of 100 poems by 100 poets\nKokka Taikan \u2013 An encyclopaedic collection with index, first published in 1901\n\n\n== Glossary of terms related to waka composition ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeath poem \u2013 Japanese death poem (jisei) is mostly made in waka form\nUtakai Hajime \u2013 Emperor's waka meeting at the start of the year\nEmperor Sh\u014dwa \u2013 Read aloud a waka by his grandfather Emperor Meiji in an Imperial Conference in September 1941, showing his own anti-war sentiment\nKimigayo \u2013 Japanese national anthem\nKamikaze \u2013 First four units for the aerial suicidal attacks were named from a waka by Motoori Norinaga\niroha \u2013 Old Japanese alphabet in 7-5 metre poem form\n\n\n== Bibliography of waka anthologies in English translation and relevant scholarly works ==\nBrower, Robert H., and Earl Miner, Japanese Court Poetry, Stanford University Press, 1961.

        "wikipedia_content": "Traditional Chinese opera (Chinese: \u6232\u66f2; pinyin: x\u00ecq\u01d4; Jyutping: hei3 kuk1), or Xiqu, is a form of musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).  Early forms of Chinese theater are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, costume and make-up art, as well as literary art forms to become traditional Chinese opera.There are over a hundred regional branches of traditional Chinese opera today. In the 20th century the Peking opera emerged in popularity and has come to known as the \"national theatre\" of China, but other genres like Yue opera, Cantonese opera, Yu opera, kunqu, qinqiang, Huangmei opera, pingju, and Sichuan opera are also performed regularly before dedicated fans. Their differences are mainly found in the music and topolect; the stories are often shared and borrowed. With few exceptions (such as revolutionary operas and to some extent Shanghai operas) the vast majority of Chinese operas (including Taiwanese operas) are set in China before the 17th century, whether they are traditional or newly written. \nFor centuries Chinese opera was the main form of entertainment for both urban and rural residents in China as well as the Chinese diaspora. Its popularity declined sharply in the second half of the 20th century as a result of both political and market factors. Language policies discouraging topolects in Taiwan, PRC, and Singapore, official hostility against rural religious festivals in China, and de-Sinicization in Taiwan have all been blamed for the decline of various forms in different times, but overall the two major culprits were China's Cultural Revolution \u2014 which saw traditional culture systematically erased, innumerable theatre professionals viciously persecuted, and a generation raised with no exposure to Chinese opera aside from a severely altered propagandist form \u2014 and modernization, with its immense social impact and imported values that Chinese opera has largely failed to counter.  The total number of regional genres was determined to be more than 350 in 1957, but in the 21st century the PRC government could only identify 162 forms for its intangible cultural heritage list, with many of them in immediate danger of disappearing. Chinese opera is no longer part of the popular Chinese culture, especially for young people, but it remains an attraction for many older people who find in it, among other things, a national or regional identity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Six dynasties to Tang ===\nAn early form of Chinese drama is the Canjun Opera (\u53c3\u8ecd\u6232, or Adjutant Play) which originated from the Later Zhao Dynasty (319\u2013351). In its early form, it was a simple comic drama involving only two performers, where a corrupt officer, Canjun or the adjutant, was ridiculed by a jester named Grey Hawk (\u84bc\u9dbb). The characters in Canjun Opera are thought to be the forerunners of the fixed role categories of later Chinese opera, particularly of its comic chou (\u4e11) characters.Various song and dance dramas developed during the Six Dynasties period.  During the Northern Qi Dynasty, a masked dance called the Big Face (\u5927\u9762, which can mean \"mask\", alternatively daimian \u4ee3\u9762, and it was also called The King of Lanling, \u862d\u9675\u738b), was created in honour of Gao Changgong who went into battle wearing a mask. Another was called Botou (\u64a5\u982d, also \u7f3d\u982d), a masked dance drama from the Western Regions that tells the story of a grieving son who sought a tiger that killed his father. In The Dancing Singing Woman (\u8e0f\u8b21\u5a18), which relates the story of a wife battered by her drunken husband, the song and dance drama was initially performed by a man dressed as a woman. The stories told in of these song-and-dance dramas are simple, but they are thought to be the earliest pieces of musical theatre in China, and the precursors to the more sophisticated later forms of Chinese opera.These forms of early drama were popular in the Tang dynasty where they further developed.  For example, by the end of the Tang Dynasty the Canjun Opera had evolved into a performance with more complex plot and dramatic twists, and it involved at least four performers. The early form of Chinese theatre became more organized in the Tang dynasty with Emperor Xuanzong (712\u2013755), who founded the \"Pear Garden\" (\u68a8\u56ed/\u68a8\u5712; l\u00edyu\u00e1n), the first academy of music to train musicians, dancers and actors. The performers formed what may be considered the first known opera troupe in China, and they performed mostly for the emperors' personal pleasure. To this day operatic professionals are still referred to as \"Disciples of the Pear Garden\" (\u68a8\u56ed\u5f1f\u5b50 / \u68a8\u5712\u5f1f\u5b50, l\u00edyu\u00e1n d\u00eczi).\n\n\n=== Song to Qing ===\nBy the Song Dynasty, Canjun Opera had become a performance that involved singing and dancing, and led to the development of Zaju (\u96dc\u5287).  Forms such as the Zaju and Nanxi (\u5357\u620f) further matured in the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). In the Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368), acts based on rhyming schemes and innovations such as specialized roles like Dan (\u65e6, d\u00e0n, female), Sheng (\u751f, sh\u0113ng, male), Hua (\u82b1, hu\u0101, painted-face) and Chou (\u4e11, ch\u014fu, clown) were introduced into the opera. Although actors in theatrical performances of the Song Dynasty strictly adhered to speaking in Classical Chinese onstage, during the Yuan Dynasty actors speaking or performing lyrics in the vernacular tongue became popular on stage.In the Yuan poetic drama, only one person sang for the all four acts, but in the poetic dramas that developed from Nanxi during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), all the characters were able to sing and perform.  A playwright Gao Ming late in the Yuan dynasty wrote an opera called Tale of the Pipa which became highly popular, and became a model for Ming dynasty drama as it was the favorite opera of the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. The presentation by now resemble the Chinese opera of today, except that the librettos were then very long. The operatic artists were required to be skilled in many fields; according to Recollections of Tao An (\u9676\u5eb5\u5922\u61b6) by Zhang Dai, performers had to learn how to play various musical instruments, singing and dancing before they were taught acting.The dominant form of the Ming and early Qing dynasties was Kunqu, which originated in the Wu cultural area. A famous work in Kunqu is The Peony Pavilion by Tang Xianzu.  Kunqu later evolved into a longer form of play called chuanqi, which became one of the five melodies that made up Sichuan opera. Currently Chinese operas continue to exist in 368 different forms, the best known being Beijing opera, which assumed its present form in the mid-19th century and was extremely popular in the latter part of the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911).\n\nIn Beijing opera, traditional Chinese string and percussion instruments provide a strong rhythmic accompaniment to the acting. The acting is based on allusion: gestures, footwork, and other body movements express such actions as riding a horse, rowing a boat, or opening a door. Spoken dialogue is divided into recitative and Beijing colloquial speech, the former employed by serious characters and the latter by young females and clowns. Character roles are strictly defined, and each character have their own elaborate make-up design. The traditional repertoire of Beijing opera includes more than 1,000 works, mostly taken from historical novels about political and military struggles.\n\n\n=== 1912\u20131949 ===\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Chinese students returning from abroad began to experiment with Western plays. Following the May Fourth Movement of 1919, a number of Western plays were staged in China, and Chinese playwrights began to imitate this form. The most notable of the new-style playwrights was Cao Yu (b. 1910). His major works\u2014Thunderstorm, Sunrise, Wilderness, and Peking Man\u2014written between 1934 and 1940, have been widely read in China.\nIn the 1930s, theatrical productions performed by traveling Red Army cultural troupes in Communist-controlled areas were consciously used to promote party goals and political philosophy. By the 1940s, theater was well established in the Communist-controlled areas.\n\n\n=== 1949\u20131985 ===\n\nIn the early years of the People's Republic of China, development of Peking opera was encouraged; many new operas on historical and modern themes were written, and earlier operas continued to be performed. As a popular art form, opera has usually been the first of the arts to reflect changes in Chinese policy. In the mid-1950s, for example, it was the first to benefit under the Hundred Flowers Campaign, such as the birth of Jilin opera. Opera may be used as commentaries on political affairs, and in November 1965, the attack on Beijing deputy mayor Wu Han and his historical play Hai Rui Dismissed from Office as anti-Mao, signaled the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, most opera troupes were disbanded, performers and scriptwriters were persecuted, and all operas were banned except the eight \"model operas\" that had been sanctioned by Jiang Qing and her associates. Western-style plays were condemned as \"dead drama\" and \"poisonous weeds\", and were not performed. After the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976, Beijing Opera enjoyed a revival and continued to be a very popular form of entertainment, both on stage and television.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nIn the 21st century, Chinese opera is seldom publicly staged except in formal Chinese opera houses. It may also be presented during the lunar seventh month Chinese Ghost Festival in Asia as a form of entertainment to the spirits and audience. More than thirty famous pieces of Kunqu opera continue to be performed today, including The Peony Pavilion, The Peach Blossom Fan, and adaptions of Journey to the West, Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn 2001, Kunqu was recognized as Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO)\n\n\n== Costumes and make-ups ==\n\nExaggerated paints on opera performer's face which ancient warriors decorated themselves to scare the enemy are used in the opera; each color has a different meaning. They are used to symbolize a character's role, fate, and illustrate the character's emotional state and general character.\nWhite symbolizes sinister, evil, crafty, treacherous, and suspicious. Any performer with white painted face usually takes the part of a villain of the show. The larger the white painted area, the crueler the role.\nGreen denotes impulsive behavior, violence, no self-restraint or self-control.\nRed stands for bravery or loyalty.\nBlack denotes boldness, fierceness, impartiality, rough.\nYellow symbolizes ambition, fierceness, or intelligence.\nBlue stands for steadfastness ( someone who is loyal and sticks to one side no matter what ).\nPink symbolizes sophistication, and cool-headedness.\nMoreover, paint figures have different types. For instance, overall painted face, and only painted in the center of the face, connecting eyes and nose.\n\n\n== Regional genres ==\nPuju (\u84b2\u5267) (Shanxi)\nHakka opera (\u6c49\u5267)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese culture\nMusic of China\nOpera\nPear Garden\nQu (poetry)\nYuan poetry\nZaju\nRevolutionary opera\nChinese contemporary classical opera\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRossabi, Morris (1988).

        "wikipedia_content": "The social novel, also known as the social problem (or social protest) novel, is a \"work of fiction in which a prevailing social problem, such as gender, race, or class prejudice, is dramatized through its effect on the characters of a novel\". More specific examples of social problems that are addressed in such works include poverty, conditions in factories and mines, the plight of child labor, violence against women, rising criminality, and epidemics because of over-crowding, and poor sanitation in cities.Terms like thesis novel, propaganda novel, industrial novel, working-class novel and problem novel are also used to describe this type of novel; a recent development in this genre is the young adult problem novel. It is also referred to as the sociological novel. The social protest novel is a form of social novel which places an emphasis on the idea of social change, while the proletarian novel is a political form of the social protest novel which may emphasize revolution. While early examples are found in 18th century England, social novels have been written throughout Europe and the United States.\n\n\n== Britain ==\n\nAlthough this subgenre of the novel is usually seen as having its origins in the 19th century, there were precursors in the 18th century, like Amelia by Henry Fielding (1751), Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794) by William Godwin, The Adventures of Hugh Trevor (1794\u20131797) by Thomas Holcroft, and Nature and Art (1796) by Elizabeth Inchbald. However, whereas Inchbald laid responsibility for social problems with the depravity and corruption of individuals, Godwin, in Caleb Williams, saw society's corruption as insurmountable.In England during the 1830s and 1840s the social novel \"arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the Reform Act of 1832\". This was in many ways a reaction to rapid industrialization, and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity. These works were directed at the middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. It is also referred to as the \"condition of England novel\". The phrase, the \"Condition of England Question\", was used by Thomas Carlyle in \"Chartism\" (1839), and \"Condition-of-England novels sought to engage directly with the contemporary social and political issues with a focus on the representation of class, gender, and labour relations, as well as on social unrest and the growing antagonism between the rich and the poor in England\". The Chartist movement was a working-class political reformist movement that sought universal male suffrage and other parliamentary reforms. Chartism failed as a parliamentary movement; however, five of the \"Six Points\" of Chartism would become a reality within a century of the group's formation.\nA significant early example of this genre is Sybil, or The Two Nations, a novel by Benjamin Disraeli. Published in the same year, 1845, as Friedrich Engels's The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Sybil traces the plight of the working classes of England. Disraeli was interested in dealing with the horrific conditions in which the majority of England's working classes lived. The book is a roman \u00e0 th\u00e8se, a novel with a thesis, which aimed to create a furor over the squalor that was plaguing England's working class cities. Disraeli's interest in this subject stemmed from his interest in the Chartist movement.\nAnother early example of the social novel is Charles Kingsley's Alton Locke (1849), a work that set out to expose the social injustice suffered by workers in the clothing trade as well as the trials and tribulations of agricultural labourers. It also gives an insight into the Chartist campaign with which Kingsley was involved in the 1840s.\nElizabeth Gaskell's first industrial novel Mary Barton (1848) deals with relations between employers and workers, but its narrative adopted the view of the working poor and describes the \"misery and hateful passions caused by the love of pursuing wealth as well as the egoism, thoughtlessness and insensitivity of manufacturers\". In North and South (1854\u201355), her second industrial, or social novel, Elizabeth Gaskell returns to the precarious situation of workers and their relations with industrialists, focusing more on the thinking and perspective of the employers. Shirley (1849), Charlotte Bront\u00eb's second published novel after Jane Eyre, is also a social novel. Set in Yorkshire in the period 1811\u201312, during the industrial depression resulting from the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, the action in Shirley takes place against a backdrop of the Luddite uprisings in the Yorkshire textile industry.\nSocial problems are also an important concern in the novels of Charles Dickens, including in particular poverty and the unhealthy living conditions associated with it, the exploitation of ordinary people by money lenders, the corruption and incompetence of the legal system, as well as of the administration of the Poor Law. Dickens was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that, \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen.\" Dickens's second novel, Oliver Twist (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it destroyed middle class polemics about criminals, making any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed impossible. Charles Dickens's Hard Times (1854) is set in a small Midlands industrial town. It particularly criticizes the effect of Utilitarianism on the lives of the working classes in cities. John Ruskin declared Hard Times to be his favourite Dickens' work due to its exploration of important social questions. Walter Allen characterised Hard Times as being an unsurpassed \"critique of industrial society\", though later superseded by works of D. H. Lawrence. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\". On the other hand, George Orwell, in his essay on Dickens, wrote, \"There is no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he believes it would make very much difference if it were overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as 'human nature'.\"\n\n\n== Europe ==\nArguably, Victor Hugo's 1862 work Les Mis\u00e9rables was the most significant social protest novel of the 19th Century in Europe. His work touches upon most of the political and social issues and artistic trends of his time. Upton Sinclair described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world,\" and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of Les Mis\u00e9rables in the Preface: So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age\u2014the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of women by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\u2014are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.\n\nAmong other French writers, \u00c9mile Zola's realist fiction contained many social protest works, including L'Assommoir (1877) which deals with life in an urban slum and Germinal (1885), which is about a coal miners' strike. In his work-notes for the latter novel, Zola described it as posing what was to be the next century's, \"'the twentieth century's most important question', namely the conflict between the forces of modern Capitalism and the interests of the human beings necessary to its advance.\" Both Hugo and Zola were politically engaged, and suffered exile due to their political positions.Russian author Leo Tolstoy championed reform for his own country, particularly in education. Tolstoy did not consider his most famous work, War and Peace to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life. War and Peace (which is to Tolstoy really an epic in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that Anna Karenina was his first true novel.\n\n\n== America ==\nAn early American example is Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), The term thesis, or propaganda novel is also used for the latter novel, because it is \"strongly weighted to convert the reader to the author's stand\" on the subject of slavery. There is an apocryphal tale told that when Stowe met Abraham Lincoln in Washington in November 1862, the president greeted her by saying, \"So you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.\" Mark Twain's work Huckleberry Finn (1884) is another early American social protest novel. Much of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism. Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and therefore resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath often is cited as the most successful social protest novel of the 20th Century, Part of its impact stemmed from its passionate depiction of the plight of the poor, and in fact, many of Steinbeck's contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack writes, \"Steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a socialist from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a 'pack of lies' and labeled it 'communist propaganda'. Some accused Steinbeck of exaggerating camp conditions to make a political point. Steinbeck had visited the camps well before publication of the novel and argued their inhumane nature destroyed the settlers' spirit. First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt championed Steinbeck's book against his detractors, and helped bring about congressional hearings on the conditions in migrant farmer camps that led to changes in federal labor law.Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle, based on the meatpacking industry in Chicago, was first published in serial form in the socialist newspaper Appeal to Reason, from February 25, 1905 to November 4, 1905. Sinclair had spent about six months investigating the Chicago meatpacking industry for Appeal to Reason, work which inspired his novel. Sinclair intended to \"set forth the breaking of human hearts by a system which exploits the labor of men and women for profit\".\nHis descriptions of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that workers suffered served to shock and galvanize readers. The writer Jack London called Sinclair's book \"the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery\". Domestic and foreign purchases of American meat fell by half. The novel brought public support for Congressional legislation and government regulation of the industry, including passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act.A more recent social novel is Richard Wright's 1940 novel Native Son. Wright's protest novel was an immediate best-seller, selling 250,000 hardcover copies within three weeks of its publication by the Book-of-the-Month Club on March 1, 1940. It was one of the earliest successful attempts to explain the racial divide in America in terms of the social conditions imposed on African-Americans by the dominant white society. It also made Wright the wealthiest black writer of his time and established him as a spokesperson for African-American issues, and the \"father of Black American literature.\" As Irving Howe said in his 1963 essay \"Black Boys and Native Sons,\" \"The day Native Son appeared, American culture was changed forever. No matter how much qualifying the book might later need, it made impossible a repetition of the old lies [... and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear, and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.\" However, the book was criticized by some of Wright's fellow African-American writers. James Baldwin's 1949 essay Everybody's Protest Novel dismissed Native Son as protest fiction, and therefore limited in its understanding of human character and its artistic value.James Baldwin's novels and plays fictionalize fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures thwarting the equitable integration of not only blacks yet also of male homosexuals, depicting as well some internalized impediments to such individuals' quest for acceptance, namely in his second novel, Giovanni's Room (1956), written well before the equality of homosexuals was widely espoused in America. Baldwin's best-known novel is his first, Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953).\n\n\n== Proletarian novel ==\nThe proletarian novel, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica comes out of the direct experience of working class life and \"is essentially an intended device of revolution\", while works by middle-class novelists, like William Godwin's Caleb Williams (1794) and Charles Dickens' Hard Times, though they are sympathetic to the hardships experienced by worker, \"are more concerned with the imposition of reform from above than with revolution from within\". The Russian Maksim Gorky, is an example of a proletarian writer, however, in the Soviet Union the proletarian novel was doomed to disappear \"in the form that Gorky knew, for it is the essence of the revolutionary novel to possess vitality and validity only when written under capitalist 'tyranny'\". But the proletarian novel has also been categorized without any emphasis on revolution, as a novel \"about the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda\", and this may reflect a difference between Russian, American and other traditions of working-class writing, with that of Britain (see below).\nThe United States has had a number of working-class, socialist authors, such as Jack London, Upton Sinclair, and John Dos Passos. London wrote from a socialist viewpoint, which is evident in his novel The Iron Heel. Neither a theorist nor an intellectual socialist, London's socialism grew out of his life experience. As London explained in his essay, \"How I Became a Socialist\", his views were influenced by his experience with people at the bottom of the social pit. His optimism and individualism faded, and he vowed never to do more hard physical work than necessary. He wrote that his individualism was hammered out of him, and he was politically reborn. He often closed his letters \"Yours for the Revolution.\" During the 1930s and 1940s Michael Gold (1894\u20131967) (the pen-name of Jewish American writer Itzok Isaac Granich) was considered the pre-eminent author and editor of U.S. proletarian literature. A lifelong communist, Gold was a novelist and literary critic. His semi-autobiographical novel Jews Without Money (1930) was a bestseller. Other American examples of the proletarian novel include Agnes Smedley's Daughter of Earth (1929), and Robert Cantwell's Land of Plenty (1934). James T. Farrell, Howard Fast, The Last Frontier (1941), Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, Albert Maltz, Tillie Olsen, and Meridel Le Sueur.\nHowever, the British tradition of working class writing was not solely inspired by the Communist party, as it also involved socialists and anarchists. Furthermore, writing about the British working class writers, H Gustav Klaus, in The Socialist Novel: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition, as long ago as 1982, suggested that \"the once current [term] 'proletarian' is, internationally, on the retreat, while the competing concepts of 'working class' and 'socialist' continue to command about equal adherence\". The word proletarian is sometimes, however, used to describe works about the working class by actual working class authors, to distinguish them from works by middle class authors, like Charles Dickens's Hard Times and Henry Green's Living. Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole (1933) has been described as an \"excellent example\" of an English proletarian novel It was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, an industrial slum in Salford, where Greenwood was born and brought up. The novel begins around the time of the General Strike of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931.\n\n\n== Young adult problem novel ==\nThe young adult problem novel deals with an adolescent's first confrontation with a social, or personal problem. The term was first used this way in the late 1960s with reference to contemporary works like The Outsiders, a coming-of-age novel by S. E. Hinton, first published in 1967. The adolescent problem novel is rather loosely defined. Rose Mary Honnold in The Teen Reader's Advisor defines them as dealing more with characters from lower-class families and their problems and as using \"grittier\", more realistic language, including dialects, profanity, and poor grammar, when it fits the character and setting.\nS. E. Hinton's The Outsiders (1967) and Paul Zindel's The Pigman (1968) are problem novels written specifically for teenagers. However, Sheila Egoff notes in Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature that the Newbery Award winning novel It's Like This, Cat (1964) by Emily Cheney Neville may have established \"the problem novel formula\". Go Ask Alice (1971) is an early example of the subgenre and is often considered an example of the negative aspects of the form (although the author is \"Anonymous\", it is largely or wholly the work of its purported editor, Beatrice Sparks). A more recent example is Adam Rapp's The Buffalo Tree, 1997.\n\n\n== Other social novels ==\n\nBleak House by Charles Dickens (1853) focuses on the corrupt, inefficient English legal system, and comments on the suffering of the poor.\nLittle Dorrit by Charles Dickens (1857) is a work of satire on the shortcomings of the government and society of the period.\nFelix Holt by George Eliot (1866) is a social novel written about political disputes in a small English town at the time of the First Reform Act of 1832.\nThe Outpost by Boles\u0142aw Prus (1886), written in a Poland that had been partitioned a century earlier by Russia, Prussia and Austria, portrays the plight of rural Poland, contending with poverty, ignorance, neglect by the upper crust, and colonization by German settlers backed by Otto von Bismarck's German government.\nOut of Work (1888) by Margaret Harkness: \"In her slum novels, Margaret Harkness highlighted such social problems as social degradation, poverty, philanthropy, and oppression of women\".\nThe Doll by Boles\u0142aw Prus (1889) draws a comprehensive, compelling picture of late-19th-century partitioned Poland, mired in societal inertia.\nSister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser (1900) is an influential example of Naturalism, and a major American urban novel. Amongst other things it explores how industrialization affected the American people.\nThe Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (1914) by Robert Tressell is an explicitly political work, widely regarded as a classic of working-class literature.\nU.S.A. Trilogy by John Dos Passos: The 42nd Parallel (1930); 1919 (1932); and The Big Money (1936). In the 1930s Dos Passos was a social revolutionary, who saw the United States as two nations, one rich and one poor. In 1928, he spent several months in Russia studying their socialist system, and he was a leading participator in the April 1935 First Americans Writers Congress sponsored by the Communist-leaning League of American Writers.\nStuds Lonigan Trilogy by James T. Farrell: Young Lonigan (1932), The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan (1934), Judgment Day (1935). Farrell wrote these three novels during the Great Depression, at a time of national despair, with the intention of exposing the evils of capitalism and desiring a total overhaul of the American political and economic system.\nTo Have and Have Not by Ernest Hemingway (1936) is a social commentary on the 1930s, that was heavily influenced by Marxist ideology, as Hemingway was on the side of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War as he was writing it.\nJohnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo (1939) is an anti-war novel written in 1938 by American novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. The novel won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939.\nBlood on the Forge by William Attaway (1941) provides social commentary on African American experiences during the early twentieth century, particularly for those who joined the Great Migration northward from the miseries of sharecropping, only to be met with brutal treatment in the mills of the industrializing north.\nInvisible Man by Ralph Ellison (1952) addresses many of the social and intellectual issues facing African-Americans in the mid-twentieth century, including black nationalism, the relationship between black identity and Marxism, and the reformist racial policies of Booker T. Washington, as well as issues of individuality and personal identity.\nBurger's Daughter (1979) by Nadine Gordimer. Many of Gordimer's works have explored the impact of apartheid on individuals in South Africa. In Burger's Daughter a theme, that is present in several of her novels, is that of racially divided societies in which well-meaning whites unexpectedly encounter a side of black life they did not know about.\nThe Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up (2012) by Jacob M. Appel addresses efforts to suppress freedom of expression during the war on terror.\nDemons (1862) by Fyodor Dostoevsky as well as House of the Dead, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and really every novel, short story, and journal written by Dostoevsky after his imprisonment in Siberia for anti-government activity.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDystopia\nIllegitimacy in fiction\nPolitical fiction\nProblem play\nProletarian literature\nSocial science fiction\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChilders, Joseph W. \"Industrial culture and the Victorian novel\".

        "wikipedia_content": "A Singspiel (German pronunciation: [zi\u014b\u0261\u0283pi\u02d0l]; plural: Singspiele; literally \"sing-play\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \"Singspiel\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations.In the 18th century, some Singspiele were translations of English ballad operas. In 1736, the Prussian ambassador to England commissioned a translation of the ballad opera The Devil to Pay. This was successfully performed in the 1740s in Hamburg and Leipzig. A further version of this was made by Johann Adam Hiller and C. F. Wei\u00dfe in 1766 (Der Teufel ist los oder Die verwandelten Weiber), the first of a string of such collaborations which led to Hiller and Weisse being called \"the fathers of the German Singspiel.\"French operas with spoken dialogue (op\u00e9ras comiques) were frequently transcribed into the German and became very successful in Vienna in the late 1770s and early 1780s. By contrast, German translations of contemporary Italian opere buffe, which were quite successful in England and France at the time, were significantly less frequent. Singspiele were considered middle-to-lower class entertainment \u2013 as opposed to the predominantly aristocratic genres of opera, ballet and stage play \u2013 and were usually performed by traveling troupes (such as the Koch, D\u00f6bbelin and Koberwein companies), rather than by established companies within metropolitan centers.\nMozart wrote several Singspiele: Bastien und Bastienne (1768), Zaide (1780), Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail (1782), Der Schauspieldirektor (1786), and finally Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (1791). E. T. A. Hoffmann, who admired him, composed Singspiele, such as Liebe und Eifersucht in 1807.\nIn 1927, Kurt Weill created a new word, \"Songspiel\", to describe his work Mahagonny-Songspiel.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nBarbara Russano Hanning, Donald Jay Grout: Concise History of Western Music, W.

        "wikipedia_content": "Sefer HaRazim (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, \"Book of Secrets\") is a Jewish magical text supposedly given to Noah by the angel Raziel, and passed down throughout Biblical history to Solomon, for whom it was a great source of his wisdom and purported magical powers. Note that this is a different book than the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, which was given to Adam by the same angel, but they stem from the same tradition, and large parts of Sefer HaRazim were incorporated into the Sefer Raziel under its original title. There were claims see Morgan 9  an unorthodox text;  are part of the cosmogony, there are \"praxeis which demand they eat cakes made from blood and flour\" (Morgan 9), That have been proven today to be false claims.  No evidence was found in any traditional Hebrew scripts, and have never been practiced by any stream of Judaism. while traditional Jewish laws of purity prohibits eating of blood. It is thought to be a sourcebook for Jewish magic, calling upon angels rather than God to perform supernatural feats. The text itself was once considered to be part of \"orthodox\" Judaism under the influence of Hellenism, but this text, along with some other works, are considered to be unorthodox or heretical in modern Judaism.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe text was rediscovered in the 20th century by Mordecai Margalioth, a Jewish scholar visiting Oxford in 1963, using fragments found in the Cairo Geniza.  He hypothesised that several fragments of Jewish magical literature shared a common source and was certain that he could reconstruct this common source.  He achieved this in 1966 when he published Sefer HaRazim. The first English translation of the book was undertaken by Michael A. Morgan in 1983; the book is now in print, as of summer 2007. A new scholarly edition of the main extant manuscript including Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic Geniza fragments and a 13th-century Latin translation was prepared by Bill Rebiger and Peter Sch\u00e4fer in 2009, with plans for a translation and commentary in German.\n\n\n== Dating ==\nMargalioth places the date of the original text to the early fourth or late third century CE. This date is almost universally accepted; a notable exception is Ithamar Gruenwald who dates the text to the sixth or seventh century. Nonetheless, it is clear that this text predates Kabbalistic texts, including the Zohar (thirteenth century), the Bahir (thirteenth century as well), and possibly the proto-Kabbalistic Sefer Yetzirah (fourth century). There are certain textual clues that point toward this early date, specifically the reference to \"the Roman indictions in 1:27-28 [which] gives a clear terminus a quo of 297 CE\" (Morgan 8).\n\n\n== Structure and content ==\nThe book is split into seven sections, not including a preface which details the book's reception and transmission. Each of the first six sections corresponds to one heaven and contains a listing of angels and instructions to perform one or more magical rites. Only the throne of God and the four hayots are in the seventh heaven. There is an uneasy tension between the orthodox cosmogony of the book and the unorthodox praxeis embodied in these magical rites; the book has obviously been edited by a rabbinical scribe, but the \"popular religion\" contained in the book is more or less intact. Some of the rituals purport to facilitate healing, prophecy, an attack upon one's enemy, and gaining good fortune. The number seven, the importance of divine names, and the prevalence of sympathetic magic all have significance in the literature of Middle Eastern magic. The text demonstrates strong syncretism of Jewish and Greek traditions; an example is a prayer to the sun god Helios to invoke him at night:\n\nHoly Helios, who rises in the east, good mariner, trustworthy leader of the sun\u2019s rays, reliable witness, who of old didst establish the mighty wheel of the heavens, holy orderer, ruler of the axis of heaven, Lord, Brilliant Leader, King, Soldier. I, N son of N, present my supplication before you, that you will appear to me without causing me fear, and you will be revealed to me without causing me terror, and you will conceal nothing from me, and will tell me truthfully all that I desire.\nThe prayer is preceded by instructions to call on several angels 21 times as well as the name of the sun. The reader is told to perform the ritual in white garments.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJewish magic\nCake of Light\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLevy, B. Barry.

        "wikipedia_content": "Action role-playing video games (abbreviated action RPG or ARPG) are a subgenre of role-playing video games. The games emphasize real-time combat where the player has direct control over the characters as opposed to turn or menu-based combat. These games often use action game combat systems similar to hack and slash or shooter games. Action role-playing games may also incorporate action-adventure games, which include a mission system and RPG mechanics, or massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) with real-time combat systems.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nAllgame listed the following games released prior to 1984 as action RPGs: Temple of Apshai (1979) and its sequel Gateway to Apshai (1983), Beneath the Pyramids for the Apple II (1980), Bokosuka Wars (1983), and Sword of Fargoal (1983). Jeremy Parish of USgamer claimed that Adventure (1980) was an action RPG. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton claimed that the Intellivision games Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1982) and Treasure of Tarmin (1983) were action RPGs. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade notes that Adventure lacked RPG mechanics such as experience points and permanent character growth, and argues that Gateway to Apshai is \"the earliest game I'd feel comfortable calling an action-RPG\" but notes that \"it doesn't fit neatly into our modern genre classifications,\" though came closer than Bokosuka Wars released the same year.Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com argues that Japanese developers created a new brand of action role-playing game; these new Japanese games combined the role-playing genre with arcade-style action and action-adventure elements. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade also traces the genre's roots to Japan, noting that the \"Western game industry of the time had a tendency to treat action games and RPGs as separate things for separate demographics\".Jeremy Parish argues that action RPGs were popularized in Japan by The Tower of Druaga. It was released for arcades in June 1984, and was intended as a \"fantasy version of Pac-Man, with puzzles to solve, monsters to battle, and hidden treasure to find\". Its success in Japan inspired the development of Dragon Slayer (1984) and Hydlide (1984). Dragon Slayer, Hydlide and Courageous Perseus (1984) \"vie for position as genre precedent\" according to John Szczepaniak, and there was an ongoing rivalry developing between the Dragon Slayer and Hydlide series over the years. The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Slayer and Hydlide were influential in Japan, where they influenced later action RPGs such as Ys, as well as The Legend of Zelda.Falcom's Dragon Slayer, created by Yoshio Kiya, is \"the very first action-RPG ever made\" according to GameSetWatch. Originally released for the PC-8801 computer in September 1984, it abandoned the command-based battles of earlier role-playing games in favor of real-time hack-and-slash combat that required direct input from the player, alongside puzzle-solving elements. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, Dragon Slayer was a dungeon-crawl role-playing game using real-time, action-oriented combat, combined with traditional role-playing mechanics.  Dragon Slayer's overhead action role-playing formula was used in many later games.\n\nT&E Soft's Hydlide, released in December 1984, was created by Tokihiro Naito, who was influenced by The Tower of Druaga. It was the first action RPG with an overworld. The game was immensely popular in Japan, selling 2 million copies across all platforms. According to John Szczepaniak, it \"cannot be overstated how influential Hydlide was on the ARPGs which followed it\". The same year, Courageous Perseus was also one of the earliest action RPGs.Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu, released in 1985 (billed as a \"new type of real-time role-playing game\"), was an action role-playing game including many character stats and a large quest. It also incorporated a side-scrolling view during exploration and an overhead view during battle, and an early \"Karma\" morality system where the character's Karma meter will rise if he commits sin (killing \"good\" enemies), which in turn causes the temples to refuse to level him up. Xanadu Scenario II, released in 1986, was an expansion pack, created to expand the content of Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu. Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985) also featured a morality system. Eurogamer cites Fairlight (1985) as an early action RPG.\n\n\n=== Late 1980s ===\n\nAn important influence on the action RPG genre was the 1986 action-adventure, The Legend of Zelda, which served as the template for many future action RPGs. In contrast to previous action RPGs, such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide, which required the player to bump into enemies in order to attack them, The Legend of Zelda featured an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. It was also an early example of open-world, nonlinear gameplay, and introduced new features such as battery backup saving. These elements have been used in many action RPGs since.In 1987, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link implemented a more traditional RPG-esque system, including experience points and levels with action game elements. Unlike its predecessor, Zelda II more closely fits the definition of an action RPG.Another Metroidvania-style action RPG released that year was System Sacom's Sharp X1 computer game Euphory, which was possibly the only Metroidvania-style multiplayer action RPG produced, allowing two-player cooperative gameplay. The fifth Dragon Slayer title, Sorcerian, was also released that year. It was a party-based action RPG, with the player controlling a party of four characters at the same time in a side-scrolling view. The game also featured character creation, highly customizable characters, class-based puzzles, and a new scenario system, allowing players to choose from 15 scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. It was also an episodic video game, with expansion disks later released offering more scenarios. Falcom also released the first installment of its Ys series in 1987. While not very popular in the West, the long-running Ys series has performed strongly in the Japanese market, with many sequels, remakes and ports in the decades that followed its release. Besides Falcom's own Dragon Slayer series, Ys was also influenced by Hydlide, from which it borrowed certain mechanics such as health-regeneration.The Faery Tale Adventure offered one of the largest worlds at the time, with over 17,000 computer screens without loading times.In 1988, Telenet Japan's Exile series debuted, and was controversial due to its plot, which revolves around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as 20th century political leaders, The gameplay of Exile included both overhead exploration and side-scrolling combat, and featured a heart monitor to represent the player's Attack Power and Armor Class statistics. Another controversial aspect of the game involved taking drugs (instead of potions) that increase/decrease attributes, but with side effects such as heart-rate increase/decrease or death. Origin Systems, the developer of the Ultima series, also released an action RPG in 1988, titled Times of Lore, which was inspired by various NES titles, particularly The Legend of Zelda. Times of Lore inspired several later titles by Origin Systems, such as the 1990 games Bad Blood (another action RPG based on the same engine) and Ultima VI: The False Prophet, based on the same interface.Also in 1989, the enhanced remake Ys I & II was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhanced graphics, animated cut scenes, a Red Book CD soundtrack, and voice acting. Its English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. The game received the Game of the Year award from OMNI Magazine in 1990, as well as other prizes. Another 1989 release, Activision's Prophecy: The Fall of Trinadon, attempted to introduce \"Nintendo-style\" action combat to North American computer role-playing games.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Square released Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden, also known as Final Fantasy Adventure or Mystic Quest in the West, for the Game Boy. Like Crystalis, the action in Seiken Densetsu bore a strong resemblance to that of Legend of Zelda, but added more RPG elements. It was one of the first action RPGs to allow players to kill townspeople, though later Mana games removed this feature. Arcus Odyssey by Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) was an action RPG that featured an isometric perspective and co-operative multiplayer gameplay.\n\nIn 1993, the second Seiken Densetsu game, Secret of Mana, received considerable acclaim, for its innovative pausable real-time action battle system, and its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay, where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time, rather than players having to join the game at the same time. The game has remained influential through to the present day, with its ring menu system still used in modern games and its cooperative multiplayer mentioned as an influence on games such as Dungeon Siege III (2011).Most other such games, however, used a side-scrolling perspective typical of beat 'em ups, such as the Princess Crown series, including Odin Sphere and Muramasa: The Demon Blade.LandStalker's 1997 spiritual successor Alundra is considered \"one of the finest examples of action/RPG gaming\", combining platforming elements and challenging puzzles with an innovative storyline revolving around entering people's dreams and dealing with mature themes.\n\n\n== Other subgenres ==\n\n\n=== First-person dungeon crawl ===\nIn late 1987, FTL Games released Dungeon Master, a dungeon crawler that had a real-time game world and some real-time combat elements (akin to Active Time Battle), requiring players to quickly issue orders to the characters, setting the standard for first-person computer RPGs for several years. It inspired many other developers to make real-time dungeon crawlers, such as Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos.\nUltima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, released in 1992, has been cited as the first RPG to feature first-person action in a 3D environment.\nUltima Underworld is considered the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence has been found in BioShock (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that \"all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [Ultima Underworld]\". Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had \"far more impact on me than Doom\". Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines, and Half-Life 2. Toby Gard stated that, when designing Tomb Raider, he \"was a big fan of ... Ultima Underworld and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in Virtua Fighter.\" Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later System Shock.The engine was re-used and enhanced for Ultima Underworld's 1993 sequel, Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds. Looking Glass Studios planned to create a third Ultima Underworld, but Origin rejected their pitches. After Electronic Arts (EA) rejected Arkane Studios' pitch for Ultima Underworld III, the studio instead created a spiritual successor: Arx Fatalis.\n\n\n=== Point and click ===\n\nAction RPGs were far more common on consoles than computers, due to gamepads being better suited to real-time action than the keyboard and mouse. Though there were attempts at creating action-oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, very few saw any success. Times of Lore was one of the more successful attempts in the American computer market, where there was a generally negative attitude towards combining genres in this way and more of an emphasis on preserving the purity of the RPG genre. For example, a 1991 issue of Computer Gaming World criticized several computer role-playing games for using \"arcade\" or \"Nintendo-style\" action combat, including Ys, Sorcerian, Times of Lore, and Prophecy.\n\nThe 1988 Origin Systems title Times of Lore was an action RPG with an icon-based point-and-click interface. Bad Blood, another Origin Systems game from 1990, would use the same interface. The designers were inspired by console titles, particularly The Legend of Zelda, to make their interface more accessible.The 1994 title Ultima VIII used mouse controls and attempted to add precision jumping sequences reminiscent of a Mario platform game, though reactions to the game's mouse-based combat were mixed. In 1996 Blizzard's Diablo was released and became massively successful. It was an action RPG that used a point-and-click interface and offered gamers a free online service to play with others that maintained the same rules and gameplay.Diablo's effect on the market was significant, inspiring many imitators. Its impact was such that the term \"action RPG\" has come to be more commonly used for Diablo-style games rather than Zelda-style games, with The Legend of Zelda itself recategorized as an action-adventure.\n\n\n=== Role-playing shooter ===\nShooter-based action RPGs include Strife (1996), System Shock 2 (1999), the Deus Ex series (2000 onwards) by Ion Storm, Bungie's Destiny (2014), Irem's Steambot Chronicles (2005), Square Enix's third-person shooter RPG Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII (2006), which introduced an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, and the MMO vehicular combat game Auto Assault (2006) by NetDevil and NCsoft. Other action RPGs featured both hack and slash and shooting elements, with the use of both guns (or in some cases, bow and arrow or aerial combat) and melee weapons, including Cavia's flight-based Drakengard series (2003 to 2005), and Level-5's Rogue Galaxy (2005).Other RPS games include the Mass Effect series (2007 onwards), Fallout 3 and subsequent Fallout titles (2008 onwards), White Gold: War in Paradise (2008), and Borderlands (2009). Borderlands developer Gearbox software has dubbed it as a \"role-playing shooter\" due to the heavy RPG elements within the game, such as quest-based gameplay and also its character traits and leveling system. Half-Minute Hero (2009) is an RPG shooter featuring self-referential humour and a 30-second time limit for each level and boss encounter. Other recent action role-playing games with shooter elements include the 2010 titles  Alpha Protocol by Obsidian Entertainment and The 3rd Birthday, the third game in the Parasite Eve series, features a unique blend of action RPG, real-time tactical RPG, survival horror and third-person tactical shooter elements.More recent shooter-based RPGs include Imageepoch's post-apocapytic Black Rock Shooter (2011), which employs both first-person and third-person shooter elements, and Square Enix's Final Fantasy XV (2016), which features both hack and slash and third-person shooter elements.\n\n\n== References =="

        "wikipedia_content": "The new weird is a literary genre that began in the 1990s and developed in a series of novels and stories published from 2001 to 2005. M. John Harrison is credited with creating the term \"New Weird\" in the introduction to China Mi\u00e9ville's novella The Tain (2002). The writers involved are mostly novelists who are considered to be parts of the horror or speculative fiction genres but who often cross genre boundaries. Notable authors include K. J. Bishop, Steve Cockayne, Paul Di Filippo, M. John Harrison, Thomas Ligotti, Ian R. MacLeod, China Mi\u00e9ville, Alastair Reynolds, Justina Robson, Steph Swainston, and Jeff VanderMeer, among others.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nWorks which have been cited as influencing the new weird include H.P. Lovecraft's\nstories, Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels, and \nM. John Harrison's Viriconium series.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nVarious definitions have been given of the genre. According to Jeff VanderMeer and Ann VanderMeer, in their introduction to the anthology The New Weird, the genre is \"a type of urban, secondary-world fiction that subverts the romanticized ideas about place found in traditional fantasy, largely by choosing realistic, complex real-world models as the jumping-off point for creation of settings that may combine elements of both science fiction and fantasy.\" According to Gardner Dozois, however, the VanderMeers' anthology \"ultimately left me just as confused as to what exactly The New Weird consisted of when I went out as I'd been when I went in.\"\nRobin Anne Reid notes that while the definition of the new weird is disputed, \"a general consensus uses the term\" to describe\nfictions that \"subvert cliches of the fantastic in order to put them to discomfiting, rather than consoling ends\".\n Reid also notes the genre tends to break down the barriers between fantasy, science fiction\nand supernatural horror.  In comparing the new weird to bizarro fiction, Rose O'Keefe of Eraserhead Press claims that \"People buy New Weird because they want cutting edge speculative fiction with a literary slant. It\u2019s kind of like slipstream with a side of weirdness.\"Part of this genre's roots derive from pulp horror authors, whose stories were sometimes described as \"weird fiction\". The \"weird tale\" label also evolved from the magazine Weird Tales; the stories therein often combined fantasy elements, existential and physical terror, and science fiction devices.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWeird fiction\nSlipstream (genre)\nList of genres\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMichael Cisco essay on the New Weird"

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_literature",
        "wikipedia_content": "Vampire literature covers the spectrum of literary work concerned principally with the subject of vampires. The literary vampire first appeared in 18th-century poetry, before becoming one of the stock figures of gothic fiction with the publication of Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), which was inspired by the life and legend of Lord Byron. Later influential works include the penny dreadful Varney the Vampire (1847); Sheridan Le Fanu's tale of a lesbian vampire, Carmilla (1872) and the masterpiece of the genre: Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Some authors created a more \"sympathetic vampire\", with Varney being the first, and Anne Rice's 1976 novel Interview with the Vampire as a more recent example.More recently the genre has been blended with science fiction motifs like aliens. Moreover, some modern vampires feed on energy, rather than blood.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nVampire fiction is rooted in the 'vampire craze' of the 1720s and 1730s, which culminated in the somewhat bizarre official exhumations of suspected vampires Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole in Serbia under the Habsburg Monarchy.  One of the first works of art to touch upon the subject is the short German poem The Vampire (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, where the theme already has strong erotic overtones: a man whose love is rejected by a respectable and pious maiden threatens to pay her a nightly visit, drink her blood by giving her the seductive kiss of the vampire and thus prove to her that his teaching is better than her mother's Christianity. Furthermore, there have been a number of tales about a dead person returning from the grave to visit his/her beloved or spouse and bring them death in one way or another, the narrative poem Lenore (1773) by Gottfried August B\u00fcrger being a notable 18th-century example (though the apparently returned lover is actually revealed to be death himself in disguise). One of its lines, Denn die Todten reiten schnell (\"For the dead ride fast\"), was to be quoted in Bram Stoker's classic Dracula. A later German poem exploring the same subject with a prominent vampiric element was The Bride of Corinth (1797) by Goethe, a story about a young woman who returns from the grave to seek her betrothed:\n\nThe story is turned into an expression of the conflict between Heathendom and Christianity: the family of the dead girl are Christians, while the young man and his relatives are still pagans. It turns out that it was the girl's Christian mother who broke off her engagement and forced her to become a nun, eventually driving her to death. The motive behind the girl's return as a \"spectre\" is that \"e'en Earth can never cool down love\". Goethe had been inspired by the story of Philinnion by Phlegon of Tralles, a tale from classical Greece. However, in that tale, the youth is not the girl's betrothed, no religious conflict is present, no actual sucking of blood occurs, and the girl's return from the dead is said to be sanctioned by the gods of the Underworld. She relapses into death upon being exposed, and the issue is settled by burning her body outside of the city walls and making an apotropaic sacrifice to the deities involved.\nThe first mention of vampires in English literature appears in Robert Southey's monumental oriental epic poem Thalaba the Destroyer (1797), where the main character Thalaba's deceased beloved Oneiza turns into a vampire, although that occurrence is actually marginal to the story.  It has been argued that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem Christabel (written between 1797 and 1801, but not published until 1816) has influenced the development of vampire fiction: the heroine Christabel is seduced by a female supernatural being called Geraldine who tricks her way into her residence and eventually tries to marry her after having assumed the appearance of an old beloved of hers.  The story bears a remarkable resemblance to the overtly vampiric story of Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu (1872).\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn a passage in his epic poem The Giaour (1813), Lord Byron alludes to the traditional folkloric conception of the vampire as a being damned to suck the blood and destroy the life of its nearest relations:\n\nBut first, on earth as vampire sent,  Thy corpse shall from its tomb be rent:  Then ghostly haunt thy native place,  And suck the blood of all thy race;There from thy daughter, sister, wife,  At midnight drain the stream of life;  Yet loathe the banquet which perforce  Must feed thy livid living corpse:  Thy victims ere they yet expire  Shall know thy demon for their sire,  As cursing thee, thou cursing them,  Thy flowers are withered on the stem.Byron also composed an enigmatic fragmentary story, published as  \"A Fragment\" in 1819 as part of the Mazeppa collection, concerning the mysterious fate of an aristocrat named Augustus Darvell whilst journeying in the Orient\u2014as his contribution to the famous ghost story competition at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in the summer of 1816, between him, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and John William Polidori (who was Byron's personal physician). This story provided the basis for The Vampyre (1819) by Polidori. Byron's own wild life became the model for Polidori's undead protagonist Lord Ruthven. According to A. Asbjorn Jon 'the choice of name [for Polidori's Lord Ruthven] is presumably linked to Lady Caroline Lamb's earlier novel Glenarvon, where it was used for a rather ill disguised Byronesque character'.An unauthorized sequel to Polidori's tale by Cyprien B\u00e9rard called Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires (1820) was attributed to Charles Nodier. Nodier himself adapted \"The Vampyre\" into the first vampire stage melodrama, Le Vampire.  Unlike Polidori's original story Nodier's play was set in Scotland.  This in turn was adapted by the English melodramatist James Planch\u00e9 as The Vampire; or, the Bride of the Isles (1820) at the Lyceum (then called the English Opera House), also set in Scotland.  Planch\u00e9 introduced the \"vampire trap\" as a way for the title fiend to appear in a dream at the beginning and then to vanish into the earth at his destruction.  Nodier's play was also the basis of an opera called Der Vampyr by the German composer Heinrich Marschner who set the story in a more plausible Wallachia.  Planch\u00e9 in turn translated the libretto of this opera into English in 1827 where it was performed at the Lyceum also.  Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re later redramatized the story in a play also entitled Le Vampire (1851).  Another theatrical vampire of this period was 'Sir Alan Raby' who is the lead character of The Vampire (1852), a play by Dion Boucicault.  Boucicault himself played the lead role to great effect, though the play itself had mixed reviews.  Queen Victoria, who saw the play, described it in her diary as \"very trashy\".An important later example of 19th-century vampire fiction is the penny dreadful epic Varney the Vampire (1847) featuring Sir Francis Varney as the Vampire. In this story we have the first example of the standard trope in which the vampire comes through the window at night and attacks a maiden as she lies sleeping. Heathcliff in Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights (1847), is suspected of being a vampire by his housekeeper at one point, which she immediately laughs off as \"absurd nonsense.\"\nFascinating erotic fixations are evident in Sheridan le Fanu's classic novella Carmilla (1872) which features a female vampire with lesbian inclinations who seduces the heroine Laura whilst draining her of her vital fluids. Le Fanu's story is set in the Duchy of Styria. Such central European locations became a standard feature of vampire fiction.\nAnother important example of the development of vampire fiction can be found in three seminal novels by Paul F\u00e9val: Le Chevalier T\u00e9n\u00e8bre (1860), La Vampire (1865) and La Ville Vampire (1874). Marie Nizet's Le Capitaine Vampire (1879) features a Russian officer, Boris Liatoukine, who is a vampire.\nIn German literature one of the most popular novels was Hans Wachenhusen's Der Vampyr \u2013 Novelle aus Bulgarien (1878), which, on account of the author's first-hand experience of Ottoman society, includes a detailed description of the multicultural society of Bulgaria, and which contains an atmosphere that is \"in some parts comparable to Dracula\".The most famous Serbian vampire was Sava Savanovi\u0107 from a folklore-inspired novel Ninety Years Later by Milovan Gli\u0161i\u0107, first published in 1880.\n\n\n==== Dracula ====\nBram Stoker's Dracula (1897) has been the definitive description of the vampire in popular fiction for the last century. Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease (contagious demonic possession), with its undertones of sex, blood, and death, struck a chord in a Victorian Britain where tuberculosis and syphilis were common.\nThe character of Count Dracula is based upon Vlad Dracula III (Vlad the Impaler), also known as Vlad \u0162epe\u015f', a notorious 15th-century Wallachian (Romanian) warlord, or Voivode. Unlike the historical personage, however, Stoker located his Count Dracula in a castle near the Borgo Pass in Transylvania, and ascribed to that area the supernatural aura it retains to this day in the popular imagination.\nStoker likely drew inspiration from Irish myths of blood-sucking creatures. He was also influenced by Le Fanu's Carmilla. Le Fanu was Stoker's editor when Stoker was a theatre critic in Dublin, Ireland. Like Le Fanu, Stoker created compelling female vampire characters such as Lucy Westenra and the Brides of Dracula.\nStoker's vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing was a strong influence on subsequent vampire literature.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nThough Stoker's Count Dracula remained an iconic figure, especially in the new medium of cinema, as in the film Nosferatu, 20th-century vampire fiction went beyond traditional Gothic horror and explored new genres such as science fiction. An early example of this is Gustave Le Rouge's  Le prisonnier de la plan\u00e8te Mars (1908) and its sequel La guerre des vampires (1909), in which a native race of bat-winged, blood-drinking humanoids is found on Mars. In the 1920 novella La Jeune Vampire (The Young Vampire), by J.-H. Rosny a\u00een\u00e9, vampirism is explained as a form of possession by souls originating in another universe known simply as The Beyond.\nPossibly the most influential example of modern vampire science fiction is Richard Matheson's I Am Legend (1954). The novel is set in a future Los Angeles overrun with undead cannibalistic/bloodsucking beings. The protagonist is the sole survivor of a pandemic of a bacterium that causes vampirism. He must fight to survive attacks from the hordes of nocturnal creatures, discover the secrets of their biology, and develop effective countermeasures. The novel was adapted into three movies: The Last Man on Earth starring Vincent Price in 1964, The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston in 1971, and I am Legend (film) starring Will Smith in 2007.\nThe latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics.  The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's Barnabas Collins series (1966\u201371) loosely based on the contemporary American TV series Dark Shadows.  It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic, tragic heroes rather than as the traditional embodiment of evil.  This formula was followed in the popular Vampire Chronicles (1976\u2013) series of novels by Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's massive Saint-Germain series (1978\u2013).  Ross, Rice and Yarbro set the trend for multi-volume vampire sagas which are now a stock feature of mass-market fiction (see below for list).  Rice's work also saw the beginning of the convergence of traditional Gothic ideas with the modern Gothic subculture and a more explicit exploration of the transgressive sexualities which had always been implicit in vampire fiction.\nThe 1981 novel  The Hunger (adapted as a film in 1983) continued the theme of open sexuality and examined the biology of vampires, suggesting that their special abilities were the result of physical properties of their blood.  The novel suggested that not all vampires were undead humans, but some were a separate species that had evolved alongside humans.  This interpretation of vampires has since then been used in several science-fiction stories dealing with vampires, most famously the Blade movie series. The 1982 novel Fevre Dream by notable author George R. R. Martin tells the tale of a race of living vampires, extremely human-like but obligate predators on humans, set in the Mississippi Riverboat era, where one of them has developed a dietary supplement to \"cure\" them, and is fighting for the right and opportunity to distribute it.\nKim Newman's Anno Dracula series (1992\u2013) returns to Stoker's Count Dracula, looking at an alternate world where Dracula defeated Van Helsing's group and conquered Britain, and gives the genre a somewhat post-modern spin. The television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, created and largely written by Joss Whedon, also explored vampire folklore in the light of postmodern and feminist theory, defining the 'condition' as humans who were made to drink vampire blood after the vampire drinks from them, with turned vampires being essentially demons possessing human corpses; Buffy and its spin-off, Angel, also feature the character of Angel in a prominent role, with Angel being a vampire who was cursed with his soul, restoring his capacity for compassion but also forcing him to live with the guilt of what he did as a regular vampire.\nPost-Colonial perspectives on the vampire legend are provided in Nalo Hopkinson's novel Brown Girl In The Ring (1998), which features the Soucouyant, a vampire of Caribbean folklore, and in Tananarive Due's My Soul to Keep (1995) and its sequel The Living Blood (2001).\nOne of the more traditional vampire works of the 20th century is Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot (1975), which reimagines the archetypal Dracula-type story in a modern American small town setting. King acknowledged the influence of Dracula on the work, as well as the violent, pre-Comics Code vampires portrayed in horror comics such as those released by E.C. Comics.In 1989 a comprehensive bibliography of vampire literature was published - Margaret L Carter's The Vampire in Literature. A Critical Bibliography. (Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A.: Umi Research Press.)\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nMany books based on vampires are still being published, including several continuing series.  Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles ended after many years, but many others have started up in the meantime.  Paranormal romance, inspired by Rice, but mostly dropping the open sexuality of her characters in favour of more conventional sexual roles, is a remarkable contemporary publishing phenomenon.  Romances with handsome vampires as the male lead include Lynsay Sands' Argeneau family series (2003\u2013), Charlaine Harris The Southern Vampire Mysteries series (2001\u20132013), and Christine Feehan's Carpathian series (1999\u2013).  However, Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series has again shifted the genre boundaries from romance back toward the territory of erotica.\nThe occult detective subgenre is represented by Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files fantasy series (2000\u2013), and Charlaine Harris's  Southern Vampire Mysteries (2001\u2013).\nIn the field of juvenile and young adult literature, Darren Shan wrote a 12-book series (The Saga of Darren Shan) about a boy who becomes a vampire's assistant, beginning with Cirque Du Freak (2000) and ending with Sons of Destiny (2006). A film adaptation has been made of the first three books called Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant (2009). He is also currently writing a prequel to the Saga, a series of four books all about Larten Crepsley (one of the main characters) starting with Birth of a Killer (2010) and finishing with Brothers to the Death (2012). Ellen Schreiber created a young-adult series about Raven Madison and her vampire boyfriend Alexander Sterling, starting with Vampire Kisses (2005). In Scott Westerfeld's young-adult novel Peeps (2005), the protagonist carries a contagious parasite that causes vampire-like behavior.\nThe king of vampires, Count Dracula, also continues to inspire novelists, for example Elizabeth Kostova in The Historian (2005).\nSwedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist's critically praised vampire story L\u00e5t Den R\u00e4tte Komma In (2004) about the relationship of a 12-year-old boy with a 200-year-old vampire child has now been translated into English as Let the Right One In (2007) and a film adaptation has been produced. The story takes place in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm. This particular novel does not follow the modern romantic trend, and instead focuses on a human-vampire friendship. Crucially, it retains many of the vampire traits popularized by Dracula.\nDimitris Lyacos's second book of the Poena Damni trilogy With the People from the Bridge handles the vampire legend in the context of a ritualistic post-theatrical drama performance. In a dystopian setting, under the arches of a derelict bridge, a group of social outcasts present an unconventional, non-Gothic version of a vampire drawing from ancient Greek religion and literature, Christian eschatology as well as traveller reports of vampire epidemics in the Balcans. The story is recounted in a minimalist style that makes no explicit mention to vampires, undead, graves or the Underworld, conveying, nevertheless, the underlying theme unambiguously and in striking physical detail.Peter Watts' novel Blindsight has explored a scientific basis for vampires, depicting them as an evolutionary offshoot from humanity who were not the dominant species on the planet solely due to an evolutionary glitch making them averse to Euclidean geometry. \nIn recent years, vampire fiction has been one of many supernatural fiction genres used in the creation of  mashups. These works combine either a pre-existing text or a historic figure with elements of genre fiction. One of the best-known of these works is Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter by Seth Grahame-Smith, in which the historic Abraham Lincoln has a fictional secret identity as a hunter of evil vampires.\n\n\n== Traits of vampires in fiction ==\nThe traits of the literary vampire have evolved from the often repulsive figures of folklore. Fictional vampires can be romantic figures, often described as elegant and sexy (compare demons such as succubi and incubi). This is in stark contrast to the vampire of Eastern European folklore, which was a horrifying animated corpse. However, as in folklore, the literary vampire is sustained by drinking blood. They do not need other food, water, or even oxygen. They are sometimes portrayed as being unable to eat human food at all, forcing them to either avoid public dining or mime chewing and eating to deceive their mortal victims.   The fictional vampire, however, often has a pale appearance rather than the dark or ruddy skin of folkloric vampires and their skin is cool to the touch. As in folklore, literary vampires can usually be warded off with garlic and symbols of Christian faith such as holy water, the crucifix, or a rosary.\nAccording to literary scholar Nina Auerbach in Our Vampires Ourselves, the influence of the moon was seen as dominant in the earliest examples of vampire literature:\n\nFor at least fifty years after Planche's Vampire, the moon was the central ingredient of vampire iconography; vampire's solitary and repetitive lives consisted of incessant deaths and \u2013 when the moon shone down on them \u2013 quivering rebirths. Ruthven, Varney and Raby need marriage and blood to replenish their vitality but they turn for renewed life to the moon...a corpse quivering to life under the moon's rays is the central image of midcentury vampire literature; fangs, penetration, sucking and staking are all peripheral to its lunar obsession.\n\nBram Stoker's Dracula was hugely influential in its depiction of vampire traits, some of which are described by the novel's vampire expert Abraham Van Helsing. \nDracula has the ability to change his shape at will, his featured forms in the novel being that of a wolf, bat, dust and fog.  He can also crawl up and down the vertical external walls of his castle, in the manner of a lizard.  One very famous trait Stoker added is the inability to be seen in mirrors, which is not found in traditional Eastern European folklore.  Dracula also had protruding teeth, though was preceded in this by Varney the Vampire and Carmilla.\nIn the novel, the vampire hunter Van Helsing prescribes that a vampire be destroyed by a wooden stake (preferably made of white oak) through the heart, decapitation, drowning, or incineration.  The vampire's head must be removed from its body, the mouth stuffed with garlic and holy water or relics, the body drawn and quartered, then burned and spread into the four winds, with the head buried on hallowed ground.  The destruction of the vampire Lucy follows the three-part process enjoined by Van Helsing (staking, decapitation, and garlic in the mouth). Traditional vampire folklore, followed by Stoker in Dracula, does not usually hold that sunlight is fatal to vampires, though they are nocturnal.  It is also notable in the novel that Dracula can walk about in the daylight, in bright sunshine, though apparently in discomfort and without the ability to use most of his powers, like turning into mist or a bat.  He is still strong and fast enough to struggle with and escape from most of his male pursuers.  It is only with the 1922 film Nosferatu that daylight is depicted as deadly to vampires.  Such scenes in vampire films, most especially the closing scene of the 1958 Dracula film in which Count Dracula is burnt by the sun, were very influential on later vampire fiction.  For instance, Anne Rice's vampire Lestat and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's Count Saint-Germain both avoid the lethal effects of daylight by staying closeted indoors during the day.A well-known set of special powers and weaknesses is commonly associated with vampires in contemporary fiction.  There is a tendency, however, for authors to pick and choose the ones they like, or find more realistic ones, and have their characters ridicule the rest as absurd. For example, in the movie Blade, the vampire hunter Blade tells Karen Jenson what kills vampires (stakes, silver, and sunlight), and dismisses tactics seen in vampire movies (namely crosses and running water) as ineffective.  Some vampires can fly.  This power may be supernatural levitation, or it may be connected to the vampire's shapeshifting ability.  Some traditions hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless he or she is invited in. Generally, a vampire needs be invited in only once and can then come and go at will.  Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot explored an unusual direction with this myth in having one of the protagonists revoke a vampire's invitation to a house; the vampire was forced to flee the building immediately. This is also featured in the American TV series True Blood, where Sookie withdraws her invitation on a number of occasions, causing vampires to be thrown out by supernatural forces. Also in The Vampire Diaries when a newly turned vampire wakes up in a house he was not invited into, he immediately flees.\nSome tales maintain that vampires must return to a coffin or to their \"native soil\" before sunrise to take their rest safely.  Others place native soil in their coffins, especially if they have relocated.  Still other vampire stories, such as Le Fanu's Carmilla, maintain that vampires must return to their coffins, but sleep in several inches of blood as opposed to soil.  Vampires are generally held to be unable to bear children, though the concept of a \"half vampire\" and similar creatures does exist in folklore and in some modern fiction.  Some fictional vampires are fascinated with counting, an idea derived from folk stories about vampires being compelled to stop and count any spilled grain they find in their path.  The most famous fictional counting vampire is likely the Muppet character Count von Count on television's Sesame Street.  Other examples include a fifth season episode of the X-Files titled Bad Blood, and the Discworld novel, Carpe Jugulum by Terry Pratchett.  Some modern fictional vampires are portrayed as having magical powers beyond those originally assigned by myth, typically also possessing the powers of a witch or seer.  Such examples include Drusilla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Drusilla was a seer before she was a vampire, and carried those powers into her undeath), and Olivia Nightshade from The Nightshade Chronicles. Also, vampires from the Vampire Academy books, also known as the moroi, are skilled in elemental magic. Also, in the Twilight series, certain vampires appear to have special gifts like Edward (telepathy), Alice (visions), Bella (shielding), that are either supernatural or evolved from their own personalities like Victoria (survival instinct).\n\n\n=== Vampire hybrids ===\n\nThe Dhampir, the offspring of a vampire and a human known from Serbian folklore, has been popularized in recent fiction.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Poems ===\nDer Vampir (The Vampire) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder (1748).\nLenore by Gottfried August B\u00fcrger (1773).\nTravels into Dalmatia by Alberto Fortis (1774), among others, it features a story of fight against vampires.\nDie Braut von Korinth (The Bride of Corinth) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1797).\nThalaba the Destroyer by Robert Southey (1801).\nThe Vampyre by John Stagg (1810).\nThe Giaour by Lord Byron (1813).\nChristabel by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1816).\n\n\n=== Prose ===\nThe Vampyre by John William Polidori (1819).\nLord Ruthwen ou les vampires by Cyprien B\u00e9rard (1820) (often attributed to Charles Nodier who as a matter of a fact only made the theater play of it).\nWake Not the Dead by Ernst Raupach (1823), often misattributed to Johann Ludwig Tieck.\nThe Virgin Vampire by \u00c9tienne-L\u00e9on de Lamothe-Langon (1825).\nLa Morte Amoureuse by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier (1836).\nThe Family of the Vourdalak by Count Alexis Tolstoy (1843).\nVarney the Vampire or The Feast of Blood by James Malcolm Rymer (or Thomas Peckett Prest) (1847).\nVampire by Vladimir Dal (1848).\nThe Pale Lady by Alexandre Dumas (1849).\nThe Mysterious Stranger by Anonymous.

        "wikipedia_content": "Ambrosian chant (also known as Milanese chant) is the liturgical plainchant repertory of the Ambrosian rite of the Roman Catholic Church, related to but distinct from Gregorian chant.  It is primarily associated with the Archdiocese of Milan, and named after St. Ambrose much as Gregorian chant is named after Gregory the Great.  It is the only surviving plainchant tradition besides the Gregorian to maintain the official sanction of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Milan as a center for religious music goes back to St. Ambrose.  Ambrose is not known to have composed any of the Ambrosian chant repertory, much as Gregory the Great is not known to have composed any Gregorian chant.  However, during his fourth-century tenure as Bishop of Milan, he is credited with introducing hymnody from the Eastern Church into the West.  Ambrose composed original hymns as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies.  \nTwo methods of singing psalms or other chants are responsorial and antiphonal. In responsorial singing, the soloist (or choir) sings a series of verses, each one followed by a response from the choir (or congregation). In antiphonal singing, the verses are sung alternately by soloist and choir, or by choir and congregation.  In the Western Church where formerly the responsorial method seems to have been used alone, the antiphonal method was introduced by St. Ambrose.Over time, the Milanese liturgy developed into the Ambrosian rite, which shares more in common with the Gallican and Mozarabic rites than with the Roman.  Ambrosian chant developed to meet the particular needs of the Ambrosian liturgy.  Although the Ambrosian rite is liturgically related to other rites and Ambrosian chant is musically related to other plainchant traditions, different categories of chant, different chant texts, and different musical styles make Ambrosian chant a distinct musical repertory.  By the 8th century, this chant was attested to be normative across northern Italy, perhaps reaching into southern Italy as well.\nBetween the 8th and 13th centuries, however, the Carolingian chant commissioned by Charlemagne developed into what we now know as Gregorian chant, which began to influence and eventually replace most of the other Western plainchant traditions.  By the 12th century, the Mozarabic, Gallican, Celtic, Old Roman, and Beneventan chant traditions had all been effectively superseded by Gregorian chant.  Ambrosian chant alone survived, despite the efforts of several Popes over a period of several centuries to establish Gregorian hegemony.  A chronicle by the Milanese historian Landolphus from around the year 1000 recounts a legend that two Sacramentaries, one Gregorian and one Ambrosian, were placed on an altar to see which chant had divine acceptance; miraculously, both books opened simultaneously, showing both were equally acceptable.\nAmbrosian chant did not wholly escape Gregorian influence.  The earliest 8th-century fragments, and the more complete chantbooks from the 11th and 12th centuries that preserve the first recorded musical notation, show marked differences between the Gregorian and Ambrosian repertories.  Later additions to the Ambrosian repertory, whose style differs from the earlier chants, may reflect Gregorian influence.   Although St. Charles Borromeo fought to keep the Ambrosian rite intact during Spanish occupation, a contemporary edition of Ambrosian chant, published by Perego in 1622, attempts to categorize the Ambrosian chants into the eight Gregorian modes, which is not generally accepted as an accurate reflection of the actual musical practice of the time.\nAmbrosian chant has survived to the present day, although its use is now limited primarily to the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan and environs, parts of Lombardy, and parts of the Swiss Diocese of Lugano.  Most recently, it survived the changes to the liturgy established by Vatican II, in part due to the prior tenure of Pope Paul VI as Archbishop of Milan.\n\n\n== General characteristics ==\nAmbrosian chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite, which is more closely related to the northern \"Gallic\" liturgies such as the Gallican rite and the Mozarabic rite than the Roman rite.  Musically, however, Ambrosian chant is closely related to the Gregorian and Old Roman chant traditions.  Many chants are common to all three, with musical variation.\nLike all plainchant, Ambrosian chant is monophonic and a cappella.  In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, it is primarily intended to be sung by males, and many Ambrosian chants specify who is to sing them, using phrases such as cum Pueris (by a boys' choir) and a Subdiaconis (by the subdeacons).\nStylistically, the Ambrosian chant repertoire is not generally as musically uniform as the Gregorian.  Ambrosian chants are more varied in length, ambitus, and structure.  Even within individual categories of chant, Ambrosian chants vary from short and formulaic to prolix and melismatic, and may be freely composed or show significant internal melodic structure.  Its most distinctive feature compared with other plainchant repertories is a significantly higher amount of stepwise motion, which gives Ambrosian melodies a smoother, almost undulating feel.  In manuscripts with musical notation, the neume called the climacus dominates, contributing to the stepwise motion.  More ornamental neumes such as the quilisma are nearly absent from the notated scores, although it is unclear whether this reflects actual performance practice, or is simply a consequence of the relatively late musical transcription.\nThe Gregorian system of modes does not apply to Ambrosian chant.  Although there are no b-flats indicated in the musical notation, it seems likely that they were understood, based on Guido d'Arezzo's description of the \"more perdulcis Ambrosii.\"\nNearly all of the texts used in Ambrosian chant are biblical prose, not metrical poetry, despite Ambrose having introduced Eastern hymnody to the West.  Ambrosian chant serves two main functions in the Ambrosian liturgy: to provide music for the chanting of the Psalms in the monastic Offices, and to cover various actions in the celebration of the Mass.\n\n\n== Chants of the Office ==\n\nThe Office chants of the Ambrosian repertoire are still largely unresearched, so only preliminary evaluations have been made.\nThe minor hours have little of musical interest: some hymns, and the simplest of reciting tones only.  The main chants of the Office are those of Matins, Vespers and the Vigils.\nThe Psalms are sung at Matins and Vespers in a rotating schedule so that all 150 Psalms are chanted every two weeks.  The Psalms are each sung to a psalm tone, with a simple antiphon between each verse.  The system of psalm tones in Ambrosian chant differs in several respects from the Gregorian system of psalm tones.  In the Gregorian system, psalm tones are based on the mode of the antiphon.  Ambrosian chants, including psalm antiphons, do not conform to the Gregorian system of modes.  Each Ambrosian psalm antiphon belongs to one of four different series depending on its final pitch.  Within each series, there are several possible psalm tones corresponding to the predominant pitch of the antiphon, which may or may not correspond to the \"dominant\" pitch of Gregorian modes.  Finally, each psalm tone is given a cadential formula that lets the tone segue smoothly back into the antiphon.  This system results in a much larger number of possible psalm tones in Ambrosian chant than exists in Gregorian chant.  Structurally, psalm tones in Ambrosian chant consist of an incipit, a recitation formula, and a cadence, lacking the mediant flex found in Gregorian psalm tones.\nOther Vespers chants include the Psallendae and the Antiphonae in choro.  Psallendae comprise the largest category of Ambrosian Office chants.  Two Psallendae, similar to the Marian antiphons of Gregorian chant, are performed on the more solemn Vespers, to cover processions.  They conclude with one of several recitation tones that segue into the Gloria Patri.  Antiphonae in choro are similar in style, but have no psalm or verse.\nResponsoria occur in both Matins and Vespers.  Their names often identify who is to sing them: the boys' choir, the deacon, the subdeacons, and so on.  A Responsorium usually consists of a refrain called a respond, a verse, and a repetition of an expanded part of the respond.  These expansions contain some of the longest melismas of the Ambrosian chant repertoire, which often contain complex repeat structures.\nVespers begin with a chant called the Lucernarium and end with the Completorium.  The word Lucernarium hearkens back to the original function of Vespers as a time of lighting lamps, and the texts of Lucernaria usually contain some reference to light, such as Quoniam tu illuminas, Paravi lucernam, and Dominus illuminatio.  Stylistically, Lucernaria and Completaria vary.  Some are proper, specific to certain feasts, while others are ordinary and can be used throughout the year.  They range from highly elaborate chants to simple reciting tones.  There are relatively few Lucernaria and Completaria; four Completaria are used for all but three days of the year.\n\n\n== Chants of the Mass ==\nThe Mass is the Christian celebration of the Eucharist.  Plainchant occurs prominently in the Mass for several reasons: to communally affirm the faith, to expand on the scriptural lessons, and to accompany certain actions.  The chants of the Mass divide into the ordinary, whose texts are invariable, and the proper, whose texts change depending on the feast.  There are several differences between the Ambrosian rite and the Roman rite, which are reflected in the Ambrosian and Gregorian chant traditions.\n\n\n=== Ordinary chants of the Mass ===\nThe ordinary chants consist of the Laus Missa or Gloria, the Symbolum, and the Sanctus.  The Symbolum corresponds to the Credo in the Roman rite.  Unlike Gregorian chant, there is no Agnus Dei nor Ite missa est, and the Kyrie does not exist as a separate category of chant.\nOnly a small number of each of these ordinary chants exist: four Gloria melodies, four Sanctus melodies, and just one melody for the Symbolum.  The Symbolum melody is quite simple, just a slightly ornamented reciting tone.  Of the four Gloria melodies, one is simple like the Symbolum melody, one is an expanded version of the simple melody, and one is a freely composed syllabic and neumatic melody consisting of only one or just a few pitches per syllable.  The fourth melody is elaborately melismatic.  All four melodies segue into a very simple threefold Kyrie chant.\nOnly two of the few Sanctus melodies are regularly used, both fairly simple.\n\n\n=== Proper chants of the Mass ===\nThe  Ingressa corresponds to the Introit in the Roman rite.  Unlike the Introit, the Ingressa has no psalm verse or doxology.  While the Introit fills in the time that the celebrant processes to the altar, the Ingressa is sung during the censing of the altar.\nThe next three proper chants follow and amplify three readings from Scripture.  The Psalmellus follows the Prophecy, the Old Testament reading, and corresponds to the Gregorian Gradual.  The Post Epistolam or Alleluia follows the reading of the Epistle, and corresponds to the Gregorian Alleluia.  Ambrosian Alleluias show an even higher degree of adaptation, reusing melodies for the texts of different feasts, than do the Gregorian Alleluias.  Unlike the Gregorian Alleluia, the Ambrosian Alleluia kept an extended repeat called the jubilus.  During penitential periods, the Post Epistolam is replaced by the Cantus, which corresponds to the Gregorian Tract.  The Cantus melodies belong to a common type, related to the Old Roman and Beneventan chant traditions.  The chant following the final lesson, from the Gospel, is the Post Evangelium, which has no counterpart in the Roman Rite.\nThe Offertorium is sung during the bringing of gifts to the altar, corresponding to the Gregorian Offertory.  While the Gregorian Offertories had lost their verses by the 12th century, some Ambrosian Offertoria retained their verses, every bit as complex as their defunct Gregorian counterparts.  \nThe Confractorium is sung during the breaking of the bread, which has no counterpart in Gregorian chant.  Finally, the Transitorium, so called because it originally involved the transfer of a book to the opposite side of the altar, corresponds to the Gregorian Communion.  Many Transitorium texts are direct translations of Greek originals, although the melodies are not demonstrably Byzantine.\nThe Ingressa, Post Evangelium, Confractorium, and Transitorium never have verses, while the other chants may have responds and verses, up to three verses for some Cantus melodies.  The Psalmellus, Post Evangelium, Offertoria, and Transitoria sometimes show complex repeat structures.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJesson, Roy (1990). Ambrosian Chant.
